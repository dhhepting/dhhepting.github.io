- desc: 'Response?

    '
- desc: 'The concept of encoding is very interesting. I particularly enjoyed hearing
    about the method of storing images such that there is a 24 bit colour pallet so
    that each pixel may only use 8 bits.


    At the end of the meeting you mentioned encoding with entropy and I am very interested
    in learning more about that, and how entropy can be used for better encoding.


    The binary question game made much more sense to me in this meeting, and it was
    interesting to see how that concept can apply to encoding.'
- desc: 'An important thing I learned this meeting was why basic ASCII was/is not
    a good language option for computing as it is only compatible with English and
    can''t fit other languages in the bit space.

    However as a classmate mentioned, there is "extended" ASCII which is 8-bit or
    more and can fit the requirements of different languages.


    There wasn''t anything in this class that was particularly difficult to understand,
    however I failed to grasp the whole reasoning of the image failed to load illustrations
    near the end. I hope to learn more about the image failed to load illustrations
    next time.'
- desc: Today's class was interesting, I learned what is ASCII in this class, and
    I saved the picture of the table because I want to check more information about
    it after class.
- desc: '- I found it interesting that the binary number ''magic trick'' was ultimately
    a unique case of encoding.


    - One concept I didn''t quite understand was to try think of entropy as a surprise
    instead of a natural tendency towards greater chaos and disorder.'
- desc: I think one of todays takeaway is that all not character sets are created
    equal, and choosing one is an important design decision that can influence a user's
    experience.
- desc: I learnt basic form and some foundation imformation of ASCII. But I prefer
    to learn more about how ASCII can help me to code program in c or html, herhaps
    ASCII just is an independent and funny knowledge to know.
- desc: 'The card game has certain complexities in starting but using binary number
    will resolve it to some extent and there are certain ways to do it but it will
    really helpful if you make a video on that.

    Thanks'
- desc: After yesterday's class, I did some of my own research to get a further understanding
    of the difference between ASCII and Unicode. ASCII, while great for plain text,
    limits our ability to share our ideas not only by limiting us to the 26 letters
    of the alphabet, numbers, and regular punctuation, but also is designed with the
    English language in mind. Unicode allows for a much greater library of characters
    including accents and emojis. While it does take up much more space, the larger
    library allows for many more languages to be used and is thus better for most
    applications. I enjoyed reading https://deliciousbrains.com/how-unicode-works/
    if anyone else wants some more information!
- desc: On meeting 3 we discussed about syllabus for this semester and also continued
    on the topic information entropy. Then discussed about how ASCII is represented
    in 8 bits and in order to include more languages like French we may need to use
    extended ascii which gives extra 127 characters.
- desc: We learned about encoding and a video about compression codes. In the video
    they use the concept of binary trees for a binary communication business. The
    business made binary tree nodes of combined least probability. Overall using Huffman
    coding, compression of large data into smaller data can be more managable. However
    if you use Huffman coding for transfering an image, the image will lose color
    and pixel quality.
- desc: I learnt how encoding is done, at first I found it difficult to see how this
    is related to my everyday life but I am reminded that there are some texting app
    I use that make use of this, which made me more interested in this topic.
- desc: would like to know more about optimum coding.
- desc: "In today\u2019s class I learned about encoding. Process of converting data\
    \ from one form to another is known as encoding. Different types of encoding are\
    \ images encoding, video and audio encoding and character encoding. Character\
    \ encoding encodes characters to bytes. 4 bits is not enough to represent alphabets.\
    \ Since there are 26 characters. ASCII (American Standard Code Information Interchange)\
    \ is used for electronic communication. It includes characters both upper and\
    \ lower, symbols, numbers, special characters. We also learned about Unicode.\
    \ It is Information Technology standard for consistent encoding symbols. It represents\
    \ as well as handles text in all most all the writing systems of the world."
- desc: I learned that ASCII uses 7 bits but it only encodes North American English
    characters. To encompass the entire world's characters from all different languages,
    Unicode is used instead.
- desc: In this lecture, we reviewed the binary guessing game and how we may be able
    to extend the table by copying duplicating the table and adding a leading bit
    on the last 4 combinations. Lastly, we talked about encoding and how the ASCII
    system was encoded using 7 bits.
- desc: on last lecture, at first discussed about binary and cards from last lecture
    and then we studied about the encoded, like the characters, colors and symbols
    have the own encoded codes and they stored in bits.
- desc: In the last lecture, I learned about USASCII chart and and how we can use
    Unicode to encode a character. Each character(A to Z, a to z, 0-9, & other symbols)
    in USASCII table represents some binary value. Computer only understands binary
    language. Using this binary value and USASCII code, we can encode any character
    or symbol. I also watched the video about Compression Codes. The most important
    thing I learned from the video is about Hoffman Coding.
- desc: As per my understanding we want to represent the infotmation for in the form
    of image we have to devide whole image into so many tiny portions and than we
    can send this image as a colour symbols. And in binary all colurs have tahier
    own unique binary code and system use two bit code method, which is very long
    and complecate for to understand for humans. here humans can decode the number
    but they cannot able to simplify the original meaning of information. So, to overcome
    this massive problem David Huffman provide us optical stratergy based on building
    binary tree from bottom to top. Thid method firstly take two least probable note
    and merged them into one and this will carryon till it can find the final Answer.
    Sometime it will create confusion for users So, for that he also introduce spacing
    method to get accurate answer.
- desc: it was taught how we can reduce problem of decoding by compressing the bits
    of code using hauffman method. by combining and adding two least possibilities
    and again repeating the process we will be able to reduce bits.
- desc: we also learnt about USASCII code chart and binary guessing game.
- desc: We also learned usage USASCII chart to encode the a particular character or
    peace of information.
- desc: 'In last lecture we learned how to encode the information using USACII table.
    Normally one can not undrrstand the bunch of binary code which contain specific
    information So, to understand David Huffman provide optical Stratergy based on
    building binary tree from bottom to top which work based on 2 bits. I f we use
    the Huffman 2 bits than at the end we loose some information for Example: one
    can try to encode image using Huffman methode that image will loose some pixels
    In other word clearity of image.'
