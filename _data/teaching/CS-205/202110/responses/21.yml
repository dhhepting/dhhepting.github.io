- desc: <p>In this meeting, we looked more at the Waveform/Frequency 3D P5.JS sketch.
    Exploring the possibilities of the ortho() function and the camera angles. It
    was cool to see how to manipulate the shapes.&nbsp; I had spent some time working
    with it for the assignment and couldn't figure out exactly how ortho worked. This
    example showed me how to use it.</p>
- desc: <p>I think the class would be a lot more engaging if you had the code samples
    that you want to work on prepared in advance, and you just went over what code
    is responsible for what, and why you did things the way you did. Sitting there
    watching you type code in near silence doesn't always get across what the learning
    objective of the session is supposed to be.</p>
- desc: <p>I really enjoyed looking at the use of the z axis to change the "camera"
    perspective of a sketch.</p>
- desc: <p>This class we looked more into assignments and the advance feature.</p>
- desc: <p>We saw a code example of P5.js, I added the sketches to my&nbsp;favorites,
    this code example could be very helpful for my personal project, hope we can see
    more examples like this on P5.js.</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we discussed about how to deal with sounds in p5js and
    how to write programs to do different things like create animations, graphs, different
    shapes with the help of sounds. We also discussed about our assignment 5.</p>
- desc: <p>For this lecture, we discussed the assignment as well as 3D perspective
    in p5.js. It was pretty interesting.<br></p>
- desc: <p>Some good idea for assignment 4, and how the code works.</p>
- desc: <p>In the last meeting, we have gone through some of the features using sound
    and how we can use frequency value to animate an image based on the value of frequency.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In this lab, we look into some more examples of the sound and image in
    the Dr. Daryl Hepting code.</p>
- desc: <p>I would say that this meeting was a bit slow. We discussed a new way to
    respond to meetings and we say the professor correct a code. We tried to understand
    the code while he made it.</p>
