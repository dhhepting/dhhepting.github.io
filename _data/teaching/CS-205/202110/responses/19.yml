- desc: In our 19th meeting we discussed new p5.js functions that create and control
    three dimensional shapes on a canvas. Some of the functions created made squares
    that shrink and grow in size, moved a square up, down, left, right. The program
    that was being made in class made three dimensional cubes go up and down as music
    was playing. The class program were just one of many programs that sound systems
    use to display visuals for playing music.
- desc: 'I found the discussion about the 3D representations in p5Js to be very interesting

    I''m honestly still kind of confused about what we are expected to make for the
    upcoming assignment on tuesday.

    I would love hear about the upcoming assignment and more about 3D modelling.

    I found our p5js discussions to be relevant to past meetings.'
- desc: In this class, we saw some P5js code example about perspective, I checked
    the reference page on P5js, they are really interesting, and I am start to write
    my self-project.
- desc: I really enjoyed seeing your puppy's bowtie. It was adorable
- desc: In this class we played around with the perspective() property and talked
    about how to capture video from webcam
- desc: We got some basic advice about WebGL on p5.js, but the references about WebGL
    in p5.js are too general and not detailed. can we grt more specific coding example
    in class?
- desc: In this class we went over the upcoming assignment, how we can implement it
    and also learn more about p5.js
- desc: In the last meeting, I have learned about different examples related to sound
    and frequency. We also looked at the Sprectum example. I am wanting to see more
    examples related to the next assignment.
- desc: In this lecture We explored about graphics in p5.js
- desc: In today's lecture, we worked on the example of the upcoming assignment but
    were not able to complete it. I am looking forward to getting done with that example
    so I can start working on the assignment.
- desc: We experimented with the perspective() property and discussed how to record
    video from a webcam in this class.
- desc: In the last class we talked about perspective, spectrum coding in P5.js. Moreover,
    we also discussed about rotating object on x and y axis coding.
