- desc: In this lecture, we discussed the assignment "Transform Sound into Something
    Else". We went through the different examples by changing the code by Dr. Daryl
    Hepting.
- desc: 'I found the idea of converting live microphone input into a shape to be very
    interesting!

    Even though the above was interesting, it was still a bit complicated.

    I''m looking forward to our discussion regarding the upcoming assignment in tomorrow''s
    lecture!

    I found this to be related to our prior conversations about p5js.'
- desc: In our 17th meeting we discussed p5.js functions that show visuals relating
    to sounds and music. Just like the early 2000s computers, some of the effects
    shown by the professor include sound bars, a moving ball, color changes and so
    on.
- desc: I have really been appreciating that we are diving deeper into the expectations
    of the assignments. I would enjoy if we could do some live coding to show the
    different tools built into P5js so that we can have a greater overall knowledge
    of everything it is capable of.
- desc: In this meeting, we talked about the upcoming assignment which is based on
    using sound as input to create something totally different. It took me a while
    to understand the concept but it didn't seem like something impossible.
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the different things that we can do with
    sound in p5.js, that is like create animations(different shapes and graphs) from
    sound, play piano, etc. We saw some of the professor's codes and what they did.
    we also discussed about what can be done for our assignment 4 and what is expected
    for it.
- desc: In this lec, you showed us the example of assignment by using sample in P5js
- desc: In the last lecture, I have learned about some good examples regarding sounds
    and how to use their frequency and amplitude. I also learned how to create a spectrum
    of your own live voice by enabling the mic feature.
- desc: In this lecture we explore some more P5 JS examples with sounds and different
    outputs. I believe that it was to do with our upcoming assignment, I misplaced
    my notes and cant quite recall if we did anything else.
- desc: In this class we mostly talked about the assignments.
