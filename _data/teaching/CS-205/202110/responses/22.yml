- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In our 22<sup>nd</sup>\r\nmeeting we watched the\
    \ very first forms of sound and video production. We\r\nwatched how movie reels\
    \ were painted with dashes, dots, etc to make different\r\nsounds. We also watched\
    \ a documentary video about how movies can show acceleration\r\nand deceleration\
    \ with the frame by frame spacing of an object. We watched an\r\nold production\
    \ example from Russia, it was a fever dream with two men fighting\r\nover a dandelion.\
    \ Lastly we learned new functions for p5.js like how the frame\r\nrate of the\
    \ moving canvas will be.</span></p><br></p>"
- desc: This meeting we watched some interesting videos on NFB by Norman McLaren.
    They were interesting and pertained to the topics we are doing with our assignments.
    In particular we watched some Animated motion videos. One thing I learned&nbsp;
    was how many frames are needed to make movement fast and smooth. It was something
    like 256 single frames with a slow tempo. Albeit it seems like you could get away
    with less if you use a fast tempo.
- desc: <p>the example of&nbsp;orthographic projections will very helpful for assignments
    and can we get more detailed coding for p5.js?</p>
- desc: <p>In the last class we continued talking about how animation and sound can
    be coded in P5.js. We saw animated Motion Part 1 and Part 2 video. Also, video
    topic name dots and neighbors from National film board of Canada.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>I really enjoyed our discussion on animation in this meeting. I love animation
    and its history so watching the Norman McLaren videos was super cool! It's amazing
    to see how much animation has progressed throughout the years.</p>
- desc: In this meeting, we saw different videos on making movies back in the olden
    days and how it has changed with time with more frames per second. we also saw
    the difference in the smoothness of the movies now and in the olden days due to
    an increase in the frames per second.
- desc: <p>In this lab, Dr. Daryl Hepting did various alterations to his code on a
    self-portrait to give us an idea about the assignment.</p>
- desc: <p>We spent some of the time watching work done by norman mclaren. We also
    edited the code to change camera position and it was a pretty fun class.</p>
- desc: In the last meeting, we have learned about example on frequency, sound, fft,
    and spectrum.&nbsp;
