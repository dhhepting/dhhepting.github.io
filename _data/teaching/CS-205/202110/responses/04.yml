- desc: 'This meeting we did a color shift background in P5.JS and the RGB color encoding
    associated with it. It was interesting, albeit I''ve already done work like this
    before.

    I worked alongside the example in class and created one that randomly shifted
    colors from dark to light instead of just a black to white and back again shift.


    I look forward to learning more about Unicode when I watch the TEDx video on todays
    meeting page and P5.JS as we move along in the course.'
- desc: After working with p5js today, I realized that it is very similar to Processing
    that I am using in CTCH 204. Processing used C to create digital art or animation
    while p5js uses JavaScript to do the same. the use of setup and draw functions
    are consistent with both, but the declaration of variables, functions, and some
    formatting is different due to the different languages used. I can't wait to use
    both and hopefully compare the usability!
- desc: l learned the basic knowledge about p5.js coding, and how the colour come
    out in code language, I think this is the basic of RGB in coding, the p5,js is
    a very interesting tool, I hope I can earn this skill of using p5.js.
- desc: In the last lecture, I learned about the pixels or image and web editor with
    the help of p5js. At first you show us about the image and then you edit into
    black to white by using the commands. Then we increment the background upto 255
    and then we decrement till 0, so the background intensity goes from black to white
    and vis versa by using if else command also we add some colours in the background
    to make more interesting. last you taught us about the hexadecimal values for
    colours.
- desc: I really enjoyed the intro the the ps5js editor and how we made a background
    element oscillate in intensity/colour. The actual math of what was going on to
    manipulate the intensities was a little difficult to grasp right off the bat so
    I'll need to further review that. I would like to know about how we can use the
    ps5js tool to make all kinds of interesting elements for a website.
- desc: today's lecture reminded me something I learnt from CS315, the js part is
    kind of similar to the CS315's lab which is fun to learn. I hope we can do more
    coding practice in class.
- desc: It was interesting learning how to use p5.js to create variables and change
    the background from white to grey and grey to white again with loops
- desc: I think it's interesting how much color variation we can have using blue,
    green, and red values for pixels. Could we maybe discuss how we get a "full" color
    spectrum using these colors, given that the primary colors are red, blue, and
    yellow?
- desc: 'I really enjoyed looking into compression using entropy (from the video),
    and I love p5.js. I learned how to program using Processing.py, a python version
    of p5.js so it''s very familiar to me.


    I''d love to apply some of the concepts we are learning in class or the lab in
    p5.js. I think it would be very interesting to program a demonstration of entropy
    or a demonstration of compression. Both are very interesting and I think it would
    be beneficial to visualize them.


    Talking about the binary card game occurred again in this meeting, and talking
    about the encoding of different texts was relevant to the last lecture.'
- desc: On meeting 4 we started with p5js.p5js uses java script, we wrote a code to
    oscillate between colors. In the examples of p5js I really liked this one :- http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/sketches/?02_M/M_1_5_03
    looking forward to learn more in p5js so that I can make some thing like this
    one day.
- desc: In this class, we learned about the P5js editor and how it works. It was fun
    playing with the code to get from one color to another and back to that color
    with different changing speeds between two colors. Also got to know about color
    coding and how it works in p5js, and how we can get different colors in the preview
    by changing the numbers of RGB, and how changing one can affect another. Definitely
    looking forward to learning more about p5js.
- desc: In our fourth meeting we discussed how binary code works, javascript coding
    a colorful square and how unicode and ascii codes came to be. I am curious how
    the english language and other languages world wide will evolve as we use more
    and more systems requiring coding languages.
- desc: In the last meeting, I have learned things regarding "Generative Design" in
    p5js editor. I have learned functions like setup(), draw(). I have also learned
    how to increment or decrement the background intensity using different colours
    as well as learned about how to use RGB to get different shades of colour.
- desc: In meeting 4, I have learnt about incrementing and decrementing background
    colors code in P5.js. There 255 different shades of black and white on greyscale.
    Black equals 0 and white equals 255. Also, for different color like, blue, green,
    yellow, magenta, and so on we can do RGB color mode. In function setup, we created
    canvas and initialized bgv as 0. In function draw we kept a condition of as bgv
    increase greyscale color will also increase and back again.
