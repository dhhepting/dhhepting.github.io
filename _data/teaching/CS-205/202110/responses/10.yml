- desc: I have never used HSB colours before so this introduction was great. I didn't
    know what it stood for before today but having control over hue, saturation, and
    brightness seems like a simpler way to control colours for graphic design. I am
    now wondering how the translation between HSB, RGB, and Hex colours occurs.
- desc: we have discussed many stuff about the assignment and also you have showed
    us in brief about the pixels
- desc: It is interesting that we can express colors as a combination of angle, saturation
    level, and brightness level. Does this offer any benefit over simply expressing
    a color as a 6 digit hex? If the value the angle can hold is not limited to integers
    we could have infinite color possibilities, but we would be limited on the hardware
    side for how many of those colors can be expressed.
- desc: 'The idea that there are many ways to represent colours was very interesting
    to me! I really enjoyed the 3D Representation.

    If I had to choose one thing that was the hardest, I guess it would be the octagonal
    pyramid representation of colour. Where is white? In the very center of the base?

    I would love to see actual uses of each of these models.

    This is related to the storage of information, and different representations fo
    this storage.'
- desc: In our 10th meeting we discussed about how to complete our first assignment,
    rasterization and the professor's website logo. In our first assignment we talked
    a bit on how to code in Javascript and what amount of comments are needed to describe
    what a program showing Entropy is doing step by step. Later in our class we discussed
    about rasterization which means taking an image from a camera or internet converting
    it from an image with smooth vector like graphics into a pixelated form or raster
    image. The raster image can be displayed on many computer screens, projected onto
    a wall or printed on paper. An example of rasterization shown in class was using
    the professor's website logo. The logo lines was first a vector graphic and was
    smooth no matter how much a user can magnify the image. After a logo copy went
    through rasterization we saw the pixels and anti-aliasing the diagonal lines had.
- desc: 'This meeting response wasn''t available when I first checked before the break
    and forgot to check again since. I don''t exactly recall everything from this
    meeting, but I do remember we experimented with rasterization and the DH logo''s
    colors. We also looked at colors with RGB hues on a wheel with degrees.


    It was cool getting to look at the inner formulas of the rasterization image.

    I think we have coverage most of what we can with RGB and images. I am curious
    at what we will learn next.'
- desc: Can we have more js practice about indexed color and gradation pattern?
- desc: I learnt more about p5.js, which was nice for the assignment.
- desc: 'In this meeting we wrapped up on the topic of rasterization and was introduced
    to the topic of colour (RBG and CYMK).

    The thing that stood out to me during this meeting was how colour can be represented
    as a 3-dimensional polygon. Like how a different colour can be represented in
    a corner of a hexagon and the Z-axis acts as a way to represent brightness.

    A clearer explanation of how graphics can be drawn via CSS would be helpful as
    I found that topic a bit challenging but interesting for me.'
- desc: In last class, we discussed about colorizer that is RGB (Red, Green, and Blue);
    HSV (Hue, Saturation, and Value); CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black). Moreover,
    we also discussed about letter dh image but did not completely understand about
    how coding was done. Hoping to learn more about vector graphics and P5.js
- desc: In this lecture, we talked about rasterization and played around with Dr.
    Hepting's website logo. Giving it different borders or surrounding it in a circle.
- desc: 'I have never given much thought to colour codes before. I have done a lot
    of work in colour theory, working with contrasts, compliments, opposites, and
    such. I always thought the codes for colours were weird but I just got what I
    needed and moved on. It was interesting to learn why there are 6 digits in a colour
    code and what they stand for. The true primary colours are also not red, yellow,
    and blue like we were taught in elementary school. They are magenta, cyan, and
    yellow and all other colours can can be created from them. That is why the printer
    uses cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. I uses a couple of different websites when
    I need to work with colours for development, art, or photography but my favorite
    are:
