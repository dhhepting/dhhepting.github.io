cooked:
- desc: Pros and cons of bitmaps and vectors -- is it true that bitmaps are great
    for fast simple renderings and vectors are best for when you need to use a
    large scale?
- desc: hoping to get to dive into how to use P5js for our assignment
    due next week (we will focus on the assignment first on Tuesday (Mtg 9) and
    I can adjust the due date if needed)
- desc: used an 8 bit question mark as an example (why would one identify it as 8 bit?)
- desc: learned something relating to the graphics technique called Anti-Aliasing,
    which is used when pixelated diagonal lines show a "staircase" (not only then). The
    graphics technique will shade the pixels on the side of the lines,(how?, why?)
    making it look blurred but (possibly
    seamless -> smooth(er)) and of higher quality.
