- desc: 'The most important thing that I learned this meeting was a clarification
    about what exactly an advanced feature could be. I implemented probably more than
    I needed to for my assignment, so it''s good to know moving forward!

    I didn''t really have much of any difficulties understanding things in this meeting!

    I feel like this meeting answered many of my questions about the assignments.
    I would love to learn about how audio is encoded, seeing as how we are currently
    learning about Adobe Audition in the labs.

    The discussions about P5.JS are related to previous meetings, as were the discussions
    about the assignments.'
- desc: in last lecture we discussed about benifits and the disadvantages of bit map
    as well as vectors. we learn how to use 8 bit question mark as an example. After
    that we also learn some graphics tecniques wich called Anti-Aliasing. we use Anti-
    Aliasing tecnique when pixelated diagnol limes show s piece of staircase. And
    we willl also used calledn graphics to shade pixeles on the side of the lines.
    it will helped it to look blurred but possibly semless and of higher quality.
- desc: "Today\u2019s class we talked about the assignment due and also the past assignment,\
    \ we went over what was required of us for advance in the marking rubric"
- desc: 'In this meeting, we spent our time discussing what is expected out of our
    assignment rubrics and what "advanced" features are. Dr. Hepting displayed and
    went over the first assignment and edited the code to show some more advanced
    functionalities.


    We also got the assignment 2 due date moved back to allow for more time since
    we just now had the rubric clarified. I wasn''t impacted by this since I was already
    finished the assignment, but I can see how others might not have known what to
    do for it.'
- desc: For this lecture, we talked about Assignment 1 and what is expected when it
    comes to examplar advanced features
- desc: I think there would be less confusion on what features are considered basic
    or advanced if the descriptions of the assignments were more (for lack of a better
    word) descriptive.
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the assignment deliverables. We discussed
    what would come under the basic implementation, advanced features, and comments
    of the individual assignment 1, illustrate entropy. We also changed the provided
    code according to the assignment requirements and discussed how it will be marked
    according to the marking rubric and what we had to do.
- desc: The comments on p5.js could be very helpful.
- desc: After discussing the assignments, I would really prefer having further descriptions
    on the assignment website rather than on examples themselves. While descriptions
    in the example can be helpful for functionality, having the assignment expectations
    all in one place is much more beneficial for me.
- desc: Its a good thing that you included more information but you have not addressed
    my particular issue, answered my emails, or my question about the next assignment.
    The extended due date would have been beneficial days ago because I made a point
    of having everything done for Monday so I could go through it if i needed to.
    I even left class to come to your office hours Monday and you did no look at assignment
    2. I have not heard from you since. I don't know what to say at this point. That
    information should have been in the assignment description from the start. Vague
    assignment descriptions leads to misinterpretations which only cause problems,
    and that is where you and I are at right now.
- desc: 'In our 8th meeting we discussed some of the benefits and cons of both bit
    maps and vectors. We used

    an 8 bit question mark as an example. We learned something relating to the graphics
    technique called

    Anti-Aliasing. Anti-Alasing is used when pixelated diagonal lines show a"staircase".
    The graphics

    technique will shade the pixels on the side of the lines, making it look blurred
    but possibly seamles

    and of higher quality.'
- desc: In last class, we talked more about P5.js. We discussed about surprise that
    is entropy. Also, talked about slider.
- desc: We discussed what qualifies for basic implementation and advanced implementation
    using assignment 1 as a demo
- desc: In our 13th meeting we discussed how to do the color imaging p5.js project,
    the group project proposal and what the solutions were to the entropy p5.js assignment.
    For our color imaging project we have to code transforming written text into different
    angles, forms and colors. For the group project proposal we were given more tips
    on how we will be marked for the entire project. For the entropy assignment we
    were given various solutions. The solutions on how to code the project and write
    comments will help us students succeed in other p5.js projects later in the course.
