- desc: 'I found the discussion on the second assignment to be very insightful!

    I was a bit confused about the spinning text and bounding boxes.

    I would love to learn more about the concepts behind the second or third assignments!

    This discussion was largely related to the last meeting as we mostly discussed
    an assignment again.'
- desc: In our 14th meeting we discussed even more about our 2nd p5.js assignment.
    We were introduced to new functions to use on the editor and what were some of
    the effects they will cause with written text and images. Some of the effects
    were changing the font size, color, hue, saturation and angle. With some looping
    functions we were able to make text spin around another text like a planet. Another
    function showed changing the outline of each letter to a different color as well.
- desc: 'In this meeting, we spent our time discussing and seeing what we should do
    for pseudo code and commenting. Prof. Hepting showed us an external resource that
    was helpful for people who didn''t understand what to do. I knew what to do for
    good comments, so this was just a refresher for me.


    We also looked at some example sketches for assignment 2. These were cool and
    interesting. Since I have already done assignment 2, they were good reference
    points to compare my submission with.'
- desc: In the last meeting, we went over the text and image sample example in details.
    Also, I went over the article on how to write code using the proper pseudo-code
    programming process.
- desc: We talked about assignment#2, gave some idea and examples of text and image
    in P5.js. Now we have more time to finish the assignment.
- desc: I really enjoyed the further explanation of expectations during this class
    and feel much more confident in what I am supposed to submit.
- desc: The class felt a bit slow but I was myself getting lost when I lost concentration
    and that is something Im going to work on. We worked on how to make a cursor a
    pencil and hopw to add moving text which became examples fir our assignment which
    is due on 9th march.
- desc: The examples posted on assignment page are exactly what I want, they are very
    helpful for my target.
- desc: Adding example sketches to the assignments is really nice to give inspiration,
    and helps direct students to be on track with what is expected given how open-ended
    the assignments are.
- desc: In this meeting we learnt about the psuedocode programming method, and the
    advantages of it. I think that writing the codes using the psuedocode technique
    is a great way to get an efficient code and decreases helps in decreasing errors.
- desc: We went through Assignment 2 and the examples you provided. The second example
    is interesting and I can add some interesting features to it. This was a really
    confusing assignment in the beginning because I was really unsure of what you
    wanted and what you meant. This really helped answer all my questions, I know
    exactly what features I want to add, and how I want to implement those features.
    Discussing commenting code was beneficial too because not everyone comments their
    code the same, and everyone has different expectations on what comments should
    be.
- desc: In the last class we worked more with words and images in P5.js. More about
    changing fonts and giving effects as well as slider.
- desc: We discussed about the changes made with assignment 2 description.
- desc: In this lecture, we discussed the writing code using the Pseudocode Programming
    Process.
- desc: 'Hello, I did enter my response but it seems it didn''t go through the first
    time. so here is my entry again


    We talked about using pseudocode programming process, talked about the revised
    version for the assignment due'
- desc: learned what is pseudocode programming
