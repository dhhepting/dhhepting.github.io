- desc: <p>In this meeting we watched a TED talk on museums and art. How people in
    the internet age takes pictures and upload them online. Effectively reproducing
    the images at different aspect ratios and perspectives. Making it difficult to
    find the real deal online. This was a cool perspective and showed to me how important
    it still is to go see these things in person to get the real experience.</p><p><br></p><p>We
    looked at a "chaos game" sketch which was pretty cool. It seemed fairly complex
    though and I didn't quite grasp how it all worked.</p><p>Lastly, we took another
    quick look at the self-portrait sketch example. I have already finished mine and
    am content with how mine turned out.</p>
- desc: <p><ul><li>I found the ideas touched on in Art in the Age of Instagram to
    be very interesting, and to be a good insight into how art culture could evolve.<br></li><li>I
    was a bit confused by the fractal example, but it looked cool!<br></li><li>I'd
    love to know more about the final exam!<br></li><li>Showing the self portrait
    at the end is related to our previous discussions about the assignment.<br></li></ul><br></p>
- desc: "<p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In our 25<sup>th</sup>\r\nmeeting we discussed\
    \ art and how people are worried that the meaning of art\r\nwill be lost when\
    \ cameras and duplicates will prevail over the original\r\nartwork. The TED talk\
    \ show host claims that we should not worry because\r\ngenerally every self-photography,\
    \ edited version and promoted duplicate will\r\nonly expand the artwork reach.\
    \ When art is distributed in various forms it will\r\nincrease the knowledge of\
    \ the artwork to more and more people.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\"\
    >In our 25<sup>th</sup>\r\nmeeting we also learned about p5.js functions that\

- desc: <p>In this class we watched a Ted Talk video called Art in the Ages of Instagram,
    then we saw a example code about chaos game on P5.JS. I hope when we talk about
    final exam in next class, we can go detials abouth question's range.&nbsp;<br></p>
- desc: <p>I found the chaos-game interactive sketch to be interesting; watching the
    dots being placed to create the fractal in a progressive manner made me think
    about how it resembled some of the work I am doing in my Mathematics for Software
    Engineers course where we take advantage of algorithms that closely approximate
    complicated mathematical models by utilizing the speed at which computers can
    do computations.</p>
- desc: <p>As discussed in the TEDx video, the integration of social media and the
    internet in general engages a completely new audience that may not have seen the
    art, or whatever is being shared. Social media, rather than removing the need
    to visit real life places, creates a growing interest in seeing the physical place.<br></p>
- desc: <p>This class we watch a Ted-talk. We talked about the assignment and also
    the final project.</p>
- desc: <p>For the lecture, we first looked at an interesting TEDx video on the topic
    of Art and how it has been influenced in the age of Instagram. Afterwards we looked
    at dots being displayed in fractal patterns and other random patterns and triangular
    shapes. In the end, we discussed the last assignment once more, highlighting the
    expectations and requirements. <br></p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting we watched a ted talk about art and the role of museums
    in the age of Instagram. I believe that museums have a role that defines the canonical
    art that is and will forever define human history. We also discussed the assignment
    and project.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>Can we get some past sample final text to reviwe or will we do the final
    on the p5.js?</p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting, we saw a ted talk video on how the originals picture of
    the art is lost in this digital world. We can only get the images that were taken
    by the visiters and the original image provided by the art owner is lost due to
    copyright issues. Later we saw some codes in p5.js and also discussed about the
    self portrait assignment.</p>
- desc: <p>In the last lec you showed us an example regarding to our assignment by
    using p5js of self portrait. And even tho discuss about our project also</p>
- desc: <p>In this lecture we watched the video on tedX about digital reproduction.
    The video is (Art in the Age of Instagram). Dr Daryl Hepting also show chaos game
    example on p5.js.</p>
