- desc: "In our 20th meeting we discussed more third dimensional shape functions.\
    \ Some of the new ones control the \u201Ccamera perspective\u201D and pushing\
    \ and popping the blue boxes. Using stack functions like push and pop we can place\
    \ the blue boxes on the canvas relating to the sound file. There is a pixel stack,\
    \ and each pixel stack layer relates to the sound\u2019s pitch in a certain time.\
    \ A perfect sine wave will make all pixels stacks look like pond ripples theoretically."
- desc: We talk about some examples of connecting sounds with the camera.
- desc: I have really been appreciating that we have been looking further into p5js.
    I am hoping that my assignment for tonight will follow the guidelines on your
    website.
- desc: 'I found the concept of perspective vs orthographic projection to be very
    interesting.

    I''m a bit confused about left or right handed coordinates, but I alway shave
    been.

    I''d love to learn more about 3D modelling.

    Our discussion regarding the boxes and cameras in P5Js were relevant to prior
    meetings.'
- desc: In the last meeting, we have looked at the example of sounds and how to create
    a spectrum out of them. This example was useful for my assignment. I also learned
    about 2D vs. 3D.
- desc: In this meeting we looked a bit more at some P5.js examples. We looked at
    2D vs 3D coordinates and how in 3D for OpenGL z+ is on the right (usually what
    would be the negative) as it is a right-handed system.. This was to do with the
    camera element in P5.js and 3D elements overall. I found this perspective helpful
    as I didn't realize that OpenGL was counterclockwise for a positive rotation.
- desc: I think learning about 3 dimensional space with respect to multi-media content
    is interesting. Is there any benefit of using Lefthanded coordinates over Righthanded
    or vise versa or do they both just exist for the same reason that different places
    drive on different sides of the road?
- desc: In this lecture, we discussed 2D vs 3D in p5.js
- desc: This class we mostly talked about the assignment
