- desc: I got question abou mark of assignment2, why the rubric said total mark is
    4 but I get 3.3/5 for the grade and the person marked me said I miss a screen
    shot, those things never were mentioned in assignment web.
- desc: 'I found it very interesting to learn about how audio is sampled and stored
    in memory.

    I was a little bit confused by that grid analogy that you used in class. I''m
    not entirely sure what it was referring to!

    I''d love to learn more about audio in general and it''s encoding.

    This is related to our current assignment due this week about image and audio.'
- desc: In our 16th meeting we discussed what is sampling and quantization for sounds.
    Sampling is using recordings of other sounds into a recording project. The sampled
    sounds can be sped up, slowed down, increased in pitch or octane or remixed into
    other ways. Quantization is a mathematical estimate used to record a sound as
    close to the original as possible. Quantization also tries to fix any sound margins
    of error a computer microphone distorted or did not pick up.
- desc: 'In this meeting we learned about moray patterns, quantization for images
    and sounds. I learned that sounds are a sample over time and images are a sample
    of an area.


    CD''s have 44.1 kHz and 16 bits per channel (2 channels).

    I also learned that to reconstruct a signal, we want to sample at x2 the highest
    frequency that humans can hear, 22,000 hz.'
- desc: In this lecture, we talked about sampling and quantization for sounds. We
    discussed sampling rates for CDs (44100 Hz) and how it is twice as high as the
    highest frequency a human ear can sense. This sample rate is based on the Nyquist
    Theorem where in order to reproduce a signal, we need to sample at twice the highest
    frequency.
- desc: In this class we talk about quantization and sampling of sounds.
- desc: In this lecture, Dr. Hepting discussed take an image as input and create sounds
    as output. Also discussed sampling and quantization.
- desc: On last lec, we discussed about our assignment by using p5js.
- desc: In this class, we talked about the upcoming assignment and about sampling
    and quantization of sounds. It seems that to understand this concept I need to
    do quite a bit of self-study but only after that I can confirm and ask my doubts
- desc: In last meeting, I have learned about sampling and quantization of sound.
    We are sampling over time in sound. We are sampling into 44100 samples / second.
    IF we want to reconstruct a signal, need to sample at 2X the highest frequency.
    I also learned about some sound effect examples.
