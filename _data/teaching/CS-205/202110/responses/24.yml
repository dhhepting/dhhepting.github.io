    \ more 3D p5.js functions like inputting squares and spheres\r\non a canvas. When\
    \ moving the sphere or square we can change the rate of the\r\nincreasing Y-axis\
    \ value making it look like it is bouncing.</span></p><br></p>"
- desc: <p><ul><li>I found the animation to be quite interesting.<br></li><li>I found
    myself getting the y coordinate backwards for a little!<br></li><li>I'd love to
    learn more about the upcoming exam!<br></li><li>The animation p5js we made was
    related to previous classes discussing animation.<br></li></ul><br></p>
- desc: <p>In this class, we saw the example of self-portrait, it give me some ideas
    about how to do my own portrait, that is very helpful for my one last assignment.<br></p>
- desc: I find it interesting seeing those videos from last week regarding how animations
    were made by hand, and all the rules that animators follow and then seeing the
    same ideas applied digitally to the animation of the ball moving today.
- desc: <p>Thank you for discussing the self portrait assignment. I can't wait to
    see what kind of interactive element I can create!<br></p>
- desc: <p>For this class we talked more about animations, we looked at simple animation
    in p5.js. We also talked about the upcoming assignment&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In this class, we looked at some examples on P5.JS that touched on the
    topics from the Norman McLaren videos. This was movement of an object/ball across
    the screen and the arm/joint thing we were looking it at last class.</p><p>Lastly,
    we looked at an example sketch of our self portrait assignment. This clarified
    a lot for me as I had no idea how to go about drawing a "self-portrait" on P5.JS.</p>
- desc: <p>In this lecture, we continued to discuss the animate() function. We looked
    at animating a bouncing circle, changing it so that the circle would move as it
    bounced. As well as slowing down the longer it bounced. We also looked at moving
    a rectangle that rotated as it moved. At the end of the lecture, we discussed
    the expectations of the next assignment, drawing a self-portrait in p5.js. <br></p>
- desc: <p>In this meeting we practiced writing codes in P5.js. We also discussed
    about our last assignment 'Self Portrait'. We looked into the code on how to draw
    a Portrait of a person and saw how we can make changes to change it according
    to different persons.</p>
- desc: <p>The coding of animation is still tricky for me, I think I misunderstand
    the webGL part for some reason and the console of p5.js is hard to help me debug.</p>
- desc: <p>In this lecture, we talked about Animation and its impact. Dr. DarylHepting
    showed Animation with different examples. We learned about keyframes and some
    functions like rect().</p>
- desc: <p>In the last class we talked about juggling on horizontal axis in P5.js.
    Moreover we discussed about last Assignment that is self portrait.&nbsp;</p>
- desc: <p>In the last meeting, we learned couple of examples on self portrait assignment.
    These examples were really helpful in completing my last assignment.</p>
