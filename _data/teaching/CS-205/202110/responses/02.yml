- desc: The concept of information entropy is interesting to learn about, and it was
    helpful to have the example in class.
- desc: 'The most important thing you learned from this past meeting:

    While it I don''t know how "important" it is. I enjoyed learning the bit guessing
    game that involved picking cards with bits (1 or 0) and then through a process
    of elimination "magically" guessing the players number.


    the concept from this past meeting that was the most difficult for you to understand:

    At first the card guessing game didn''t make much sense, but I understood it after
    a couple examples. The rest of the meeting was more or less just facts and statements
    that I''d learned before.


    What you would like to know more about

    I look forward to watching the "Information Entropy" video that is posted on the
    CS 205 Meeting 2 page, I noticed in class that it is from Khan Academy so I figure
    it must be good.. I had not noticed it before the class.

    I also want to learn more about why ASCII is so bad/no adaptable. I think we covered
    most of it at the end of the class, it only covers simple English language, but
    maybe there are more cons to it.'
- desc: By far my favourite part of today's class was seeing your puppy, but the logic
    behind the four cards and asking yes and no questions to get to one concrete result
    was super interesting. I hadn't watched the video prior to our meeting, so it
    was a little confusing in the beginning, but now after watching the video and
    having the in-class demonstration, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp of the
    topic.
- desc: I would like to learn more about how entropy can be applied to software designs
- desc: After class, I googled the binary card game and I am not sure I understood
    the rule of game correctly, because the introduction of game online is kind of
    different from the binary game on class. On the other hand, is the principle of
    the binary game similar to truth table of k-map?
- desc: 'In the last meeting, we learned about the binary number pattern using the
    example of picking a card. If we have 1 bit, we can represents 2 decimal numbers.
    If we have 2 bits, then we can represents 4 decimal numbers. In general, if have
    n number of bits, we can represents 2^n decimal numbers. The example of picking
    up a card was little bit difficult to understand. Overall, it was a good lecture
    and was able to understand most of the stuff related to binary system.
