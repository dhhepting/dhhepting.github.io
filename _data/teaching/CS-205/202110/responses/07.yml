    '
- desc: Before today, I hadn't really thought about how bitmaps worked by essentially
    splitting the image or symbol into a grid to represent it using individual pixels.
    I thought it was cool when we broke the letter "a" down into its basic shapes
    of a semi-circle and a line to illustrate the bitmap.
- desc: 'I found exactly how bitmaps work to be very interesting!

    I''m not entirely clear on what rasterization is, and would love to learn more
    about that.

    I would also be curious about learning how these vectors or rasterizations are
    encoded.

    This is all connected to our labs with Adobe Illustrator, where we also learned
    a bit about vector and rasterization graphics.'
- desc: we discussed how the pixel and vector built the graph. user can set a pixel
    as start point and use vector to start an array function to draw rest part.
- desc: 'This meeting I learned about Bitmap and Vector imaging. Bitmap imaging is
    pixel addressable while vectors are comprised of objects and math formulas. Resizing
    bitmaps causes loss of quality while vectors can be resized as much as you like
    without any loss of quality.


    I learned that bitmaps/ rasters are set with a transpose table, however didn''t
    quite fully understand it.

    I hope we finish up on that next lecture.'
- desc: In our 7th meeting we discussed a bit about vectors and bit maps. When it
    came to zooming in on an image or a Logo, the bit maps will show distinct pixels
    at a certain point while vectors, using the power of math, can keep the original
    image quality of the lines and shapes no matter how zoomed in.
- desc: 'In this meeting, I learned the high-level theory of how characters are displayed.

    The concept that was the most difficult to wrap my head around was how vector
    graphics are displayed differently than vector graphics.

    Something I would like to know is how are vectors more scaleable

    Something that was related to the topic of this meeting was in the lab. Where
    in photoshop If I were to zoom in enough I could see the individual pixels/bits.'
- desc: We spend some class time discussing URCourses & Dr. Hepting's website's interconnectivity.
    We also continued on talking about UTF-8, bitmaps, and vectors
- desc: I think its interesting that everything we type and read is either stored
    as a bitmap or vector, I wonder if there would ever be a use for a display that
    uses raw vectors rather than converting to bitmaps to display them, maybe futuristic
    displays capable of changing size dynamically?
- desc: Learning about how characters can be displayed with bitmaps and vectors was
    great. I was unable to read a few words so just wanted to request if you can please
    write a bit more clearer.
- desc: 'Thanks for making the changes to URcourses to make finding the relevant info
    for each class/meeting more easily findable and easier to navigate.


    Honestly it is a bit difficult to follow along with class notes since I''m finding
    it very difficult to make out what you''re writing and not everything that you
    write is verbally expressed or easily understood by you just saying it. I''m sure
    there are others who may feel the same way. In light of this, would you kindly
    consider typing the notes as you go? Or you may want to use a note taking app
    that has the ability to turn handwriting into typed text. Either way please see
    if there is something you can do moving forward, it would be greatly appreciated.
    Thanks!'
- desc: Honestly I was a little bit confuse for this class but i enjoyed learning
    ASCII code
- desc: In this class we saw video about compression code. I learned 2 ways to represent
    characters for display, which are bitmaps and vectors. Bitmap are stored as a
    series of tiny dots which is known as Pixel. Pixel is also known as picture elements.
    Vector store mathematical description of image contents.
- desc: In last lecture, I have learned that there are two ways(Bitmaps & Vectors)
    to represent character to display. I have also learned about how UTF-8 code can
    be represented in the 7x7 bitmap matrix to display a character.
