- desc: In this lecture, we discussed recording a sound file and sound generation
    as well as arrays. We looked at how images can be translated into sound. Display
    image pixel by pixel, choose pixel at random, display pixel from the image and
    use that pixel RGB to set the sound generation parameters.
- desc: 'I found it very interesting to learn about how to use audio with P5JS

    I was also a little confused during the discussion about assignment 3, but I think
    I''ll be able to figure it out.

    I''d love to learn more about the encoding of audio and how it interacts with
    other systems.

    I found the discussion about the assignment to relate to prior discussions about
    the assignments, and our discussions about P5JS'
- desc: In this lecture, you showed about exploration in mars by the robots with the
    help of article. Its very interesting topic because mars has only 21 perc of oxygen
    and it is very hard to survive for the human for now but for robots its very good.
    To see and explore another planet also get to know about there nature, species
    and many more. Afterwards you showed us the example for our next assignment sound
    to image.
- desc: I have really appreciated the increased focus on the assignment requirements
    recently. I enjoyed how in-depth we got in your example for assignment 3 that
    is due next week. I would appreciate it if we could take a look at more examples
    of P5js's functionality past what we are doing for assignments so that we go into
    our projects with more information.
- desc: In our 15th meeting we discussed about more p5.js functions that relate to
    sounds and what can that do with colors. Some of the functions will make a beeping
    sound and other functions will control its pitch, tone, volume, duration and so
    on. With our next p5.js project we will have to show a way sound interacts with
    colors on a canvas.
- desc: In this class we went over ingenuity and some talks of UFO's . We also talked
    about the assignment due tonight and also the next one due.
- desc: 'In this meeting we discussed the upcoming meeting with guest speaker , Larry
    Matthies, who worked on the Mars Perseverance/Ingenuity project and has a bachelors
    degree from the U of R.


    We also looked at code that was updated for our assignment 2 and assignment 3,
    the sound one. This was definitely helpful as I havent tried completing the sound
    assignment yet and had no idea that we could fill in an existing image and output
    sound based on the color of the pixel.'
- desc: good explication for assignments, but do we have to do comments for every
    line?
- desc: In this meeting, we discussed about the online event by Larry Matthies on
    Robotic Mars Exploration and how to register for the event. Later we discussed
    about our 3rd assignment - connect image and sound, and saw a p5.js sketch on
    how to convert an image to a sound.
- desc: 'In meeting#15, we talked about the event (Larry Matthies: Robotic Mars Exploration)
    taking place on March 24th over zoom. Then, we looked at an example of spinning
    text, which was really helpful for assignment#2. We also looked at an example
    of image-to-sound, which will be helpful for assignment#3.'
- desc: In the last class we talked about robotic mars exploration. And also about
    Images and sound example of P5.js - uploading sound file and using into code.
- desc: in last lecture we explore other functions of p5.js to create sound from as
    per the image pixels.
- desc: in last meeting, we have looked at p5.js code which was an example of image
    to sound. and that will be very helpful for upcoming assignment. professor has
    shared a link for Mars exploration event.
- desc: in last lecture, we discussed about the p5.js functionalities for image-to-sound
    project. we also got a chance to register ourselves for an event which will be
    on Mars Perseverance project.
- desc: discussion on robotic mars exploration
