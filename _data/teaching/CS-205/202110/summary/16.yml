- desc: how's everyone doing today. Okay. can't complain too much. Good to spend the
    afternoon with you. questions or concerns about. Anything course related. Oh,
    get the project stuff set up. or. go through that tomorrow with the marker. And
    then the second assignment should be back sometime next week. And then we'll talk
    a bit more about sound today. let's see you first do the attendance. Oh, I didn't
    share my screen yet so. Pictures I posted the other day last after last day. So
    here's my window. which I look through to see the snowflakes you can see, this
    still maybe it's slowly. it's not quite. clearly visible that you can still see
    there's a screen there. So here's the zoom in a little bit. reflection of the
    room lights. So, because it's a if we think about this as an image. creech Square
    and the screen in the screen grid. Then we're going to want to pick a single value
    to represent. what's visible through through that screen. Through that screen
    grid cell. So sometimes it's easier to do because there's a single. single color
    there, but other times it's not. Not a single value, and then we have to choose
    and that's where we. The sampling is. Not fine enough. We don't have enough resolution
    of the sampling, then we won't be able to reconstruct. The underlying phenomenon.
    accurately. picture is a preview of the one I took on my iPhone it's a high efficiency
    image. See I can't see stands for. But, so this is a smaller. preview. So the
    three sampling. And there is what gets shown on the and the preview is these.
    artifacts. That are invisible and I resolution image. And they're called more
    more a patterns. about the alignment of. The screen grid. With the creation. preview
    image. In the original. The original. cram more. kind of hit more information
    into smaller space. And so it's hit and Miss whether what. device we get. presented
    and sort of the. idea here is that we see that, because the screen isn't perpendicular
    to the. This isn't aligned with the image script that. We see. A little bit here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: So here's another version of that So this is the jpeg. version that got posted
    to the website. looked at. pick. Try to pick a particular. screen. This is the
    boundary of the screen grid. We can see. So. Imagine. When the original image,
    the screen. So each each opening in the screen and that screen grid. would be
    a place to sample and so you would pick. One choice of color based on the information
    we have here. That makes sense. So the spatial resolution is the. Is the number
    of samples are going to take an image. And the samples are. Each samples associated
    of the pixel. And if you want to preserve the. mapping of the original phenomenon
    to the image, then. The samples will be taken equal distantly. And x&y so. pixels
    will. Be Square. The square shape. pixels and cells are samples of the underlying
    phenomena. are going to take the intensity. In grayscale or our. Full color red
    green and blue. So, to be intensity and Gray, or in value or enter a. code red
    green and blue. So traditionally that's been. custom colors 24 bit color so we
    take a. Look at it get a reading of intensity for red green and blue. So we could
    add more. To the. sample surette greenham frizzy intensity sample for is green
    and blue. So you might have a to take 12 or. that's that's the idea. of how we
    associate the samples. two words that i've used before in class. precision, we
    have to store.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Each.
  persid: ???
- desc: How much precision with which we still can story sample. I think I never blanks.
    Anyway, so it's approximately the right number of blanks. Thanks for taking quantization.
    So that's. that's the bit depth as another way to say. This. Free sample. aliasing.
    And more a pattern is an effective aliasing is a. symptom of aliasing. We don't
    have enough samples. And enough precision about the samples to. to reconstruct
    the. The underlying phenomenon. try and draw again. Give me a second year. Better.
    Standards sampling quantization for sounds like there's some standards we know
    about.

  persid: S09
- desc: yup better
  persid: S06
- desc: oh, thx
  persid: S07
- desc: thanks
  persid: S06
- desc: Most audio samples have something called a sample rate.  How many samples
    are taken in a second.
  persid: S05
- desc: CD sampling rate is 44khz
  persid: S09
- desc: 44100 kHz
  persid: S09
- desc: what would a vinyl record be at?
  persid: S07
- desc: oh I see
  persid: S07
- desc: what's the last word
  persid: S09
- desc: thank you
  persid: S09
- desc: You have to sample at 2x of the highest frequency to prevent loss of information
  persid: S09
- desc: I guess you forget to give us the attendance password.
  persid: S10

  persid: S11

    you want to share, there is a check-box at the bottom where you can select 'share
    desktop audio'
