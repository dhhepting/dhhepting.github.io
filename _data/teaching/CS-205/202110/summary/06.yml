- desc: realized, I was muted there for a second okay. So. let's go back to. screen.
    Okay, so this is. A line for today. So the decode unicode. kind of fun video.
    That was made a few years ago, but every with every iteration of every release
    of the unicode there gets to be more and more characters. And as you look at Matthew
    carter's my life and typefaces. Another is interesting because. Cocteau designing
    for different displays. Designing some plans for. Certain resolution displays
    was the challenge of the time we undertook many challenging activities and. Then
    they. A particular challenge at a given time that. relented. wanted to find some
    other ones. some more general terms here. Okay, so. To answer some more questions
    from last day. Do you see my reply that it says, I would talk about some of these
    extra bits and so on. So I thought, maybe these so just watch a little bit of
    this. Video. But compression codes. Probably not convenient for the audio but
    i'll make i'll put the captions on. Okay. Do you see a connection there between.
    entropy and encoding for. UCF encoding UCF eight encoding of unicode symbols.
    Okay, so.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Let me.
  persid: ???
- desc: By the way. Having these two classes back to back sometimes. Let me just do
    this quickly. Okay here's the presentation. generator myself. About that i'm still
    finding. Some issues I need to tweak in your courses. Okay. So let me clear up
    from my mistake anyone find my mistake you and see my hand from the state that
    mistake. intuit is six and six decimal and binary. Because, all I did was I wrote.
    A can twice, I did can hear Gray so eight plus. Two Stan is a, but I also did
    eight plus. Two is six no that's not right, so these two bitches slept so I should
    have got 0110. So. This changes. To the date was correct, but this should change
    to a nine. Because those two bits are flip. And that's correct. So here's the
    encoded. smiling face smiling eyes. You can see here. On the. Page unicode.org.
    here's our smiling faces smiling guy So you can see that there's a number of different.
    Alternative. representations. unicode. unicode code point. So the number that.
    corresponds to the character. lead us to. This one. So, separate from the. satanic.
    ideal of the smiling SMILEY face smiling is. This code points or expresses the
    ideal. And this is. What what what different platforms realize provide to this
    realization of that ideal. So this is apple. You see my cursor is and then. Google
    and Facebook. And the i'm not sure what windows. windows, I guess. And Twitter.
    and so on. So we'll talk about. Those in a minute or maybe on Monday on Tuesday.
    next level of. realization we can realize the texts that were encoding. look carefully
    at these this table. The sort of the order of the. emojis is different than their
    colored points the code points aren't in numerical order. Determined determined
    by. locale data. character locale data register cl Dr. that's what this is. That
    abbreviation. Okay, so let's go back to. Our example with a salon. Okay, so if
    we have an ascii character. etfs eight. If we're sending. Now, for we say that
    we're going to. send a message and etfs aid. The only bites that can be perceived
    be ever then. The only advice to the leading zero are one byte characters which
    correspond. To the historical asking. characters are common. So you can think
    of them as being. At the top of the. probability tree, so they get the shortest
    code. And the code starts with. zero. So what does it mean to. leading not lending.
    is meant to say that anyway. That worksheet. curious based on the Wikipedia page.
    So we can say that maybe have one. Leading that meets means as part of a multi.
    The continuation. Of the message. we've missed we've missed started the message
    if we. tune in and we find a bike that one as one zero To begin with, that means
    it's. Either the second, third or fourth bite of multi byte character. mean. Right.
    there's one how many ones are there 121. We can have up to four Bytes so we could
    have one. preceded by for that, for one. And zero bed. makes sense. to buy. to
    buy a message character encoding. One continuation. So it has this has the advantage
    of. We only have to wait until we get a. bite, starting with zero, which means
    it'll be a single bite character. And self contained character self contained
    within a bite so that's the leading leading zero if it has a leading 110, then
    we have to only wait until we get. Zero or. One to avoid it has leading multiple
    leading ones. So if we saw a continuation bite like this. In a message like this.
    Making sense. And I understand why Oh, thank you. Emily. Okay, so we have five.
    Leading by. Four by character. We need three by three that's. The first. And then
    we have. One zero start the continuation bite, and then we have. six sets of data.
    here. We don't know how many, we have to wait for except that. We have. the middle
    of something. So we just need to. check the next one, so we're in the middle.
    And then, when we start we if we encountered this bike. And we know. The start
    and because we see for that view for one that's at the beginning, we know they're
    gonna be for by itself together. So, in terms of transmission. We don't need to.
    wait for any other characters. Once we get a new character here. So we get a.
    start by then we can. move from mill you know there were a lot of middle or at
    the start, so we can reset our. Our decoding here. So do we. have been converting
    between binary and hex. or. Changing notations. If you read these and write these
    betsen into hexadecimal. see what I can. Be. i'm not sure if I specified a valid
    here to here, I think I should be all right. There are some. stipulations. This
    ETF 16 only permits. 20 bits total and here we have 21. So that there's some.
    can't express more than. 16. anyway. I think the web page to do a fairly good
    job of explaining that once i've linked. Not to. I would say the details are interesting
    but not so important in terms of our. interest here. Let me do one thing here.
    So 100 is eight. And then 1011 is 11 which is. Be. So I can look that up. should
    be able to find something. So any conversion between binary hacks. Group. In front
    of it. So the. No. sweet, we can write them in. Other groupings of numbers. So
    instead of grouping four bits together we can group three bits together. And those
    are called octo. What is every leave us with. two. Eight anyone get eight Oh,
    I see in the chat okay thanks. guys range from zero to seven. Maybe easier to
    read these continuation characters. Right over that 107077. don't worry it'll.
    Be tomorrow is not so helpful, I was reading about. In and storing. Using auto
    presentation, because they be. A continuation of six bits of data. And then, in
    this case, there was. Three bits of data and the leading plate as well. So makes
    for. I also want to. touch on the idea of. not creating different representations.
    Which is grouping things differently in terms of. binary hex and optimal. they're
    just. ways that unicode is organized. So at the. Center. Of the. dmca encoding
    is. Is the seven paths for the ascii so. The lowest order bite. Is. ascii So those
    are the most frequent these characters. And then. Then, to add all the different
    kinds of Latin. characters for the different languages, their accents and we need
    to buy because this 11 bits of data allows us to you to get most of those characters.
    And then, with 16. Yes. Basic multilingual plain. Chinese Japanese and Korean.
    characters that are common. force plate. Access to other planes. I think there
    are 17 other planes that are defined. So let me show you how i'm unicode. My rambling
    too much well probably yes that's just. rambling too much, but. The message gets
    through. We get immediate access to the basic multi lingual plane. Without any
    so we're using two bites as our unit. starts we don't have anything any. characters
    encoded in less than two byte. This. These two bites will access the basic multilingual
    plane. And then we can add another two bites to access the other. plane planes.
    So, because of the limitations of UCF 16 in terms of. How it. encodes ease of
    supplemental planes and so on. We can access. All the. available. To the 20. 16
    encode the same code points from this. Collection of to the 20. copy this down.
    characters. thousand and 59 characters use. This in March 2020 and they have.
    A they have plans to I think the last time they added about 5000 characters. So
    they have a plan to roll out more and more characters. More and more to support
    more and more languages. Like was discussed in that video about the unicode decoding
    unicode. Any questions or comments about that. So the idea is. That there are
    these different assignments. And i'm not sure. If these are. A New York. So. here's
    an example of a note of a sketch to do. To illustrate entropy. So you can use
    that as a. entropy example. So you can use that as a starting point. So I apologize
    for not talking about this. On Tuesday. The I set the first two days, to the tune
    of two weeks from the past Tuesday. Okay, so. message in the chat so, can you
    please repeat, is a direct message, can you please repeat it as a message to everyone.
    Okay, so basically how I got the different numbers, so this is a chart chart was
    in is. very similar to presently in the Wikipedia page. So when there's one bite
    this seven there's a leading zero Plus seven bits of data. mark by the axis. And
    then there's two bites. In. The continuation byte six bits of data and the continuation
    byte. And five bits of data in leading bite. So that I get 11 for that. And then.
    Three bites. six plus six bits of data is 12 and then four bits. leading place
    on 16. For the 16 bits of data. equals a to buy. You equal to Bytes of data. which
    corresponds to the basic multi lingual playing. We can access using UCF 16 112
    white word of etfs 16. Okay. I got it okay. Anyway, every day, tired of talking
    about zeros and ones. that's not quite true. anyway. So back to. So you can make
    the dates a little different. How many people are just gonna say simon's page
    for for a. Now. State can be flexible. Just as a way to get you give you some
    experience with. P five GS and the concepts are talking about in class. So let
    me know about the date, and we can change it. As required so don't worry don't
    worry about the date. The first one, and then the second. there's a project that
    you can do in small groups let's say. And I should say bless you. generally. So
    let's say groups of up to four she like and then you can think about. Something
    that we're doing. In terms of writing a. web based. interactive web based multimedia
    presentation of your topic so that's the deliverable. And so, think about. Some
    of these things. And how much you're going to research and how much you're going
    to write in P five js how much text you want to write and. How much coding, you
    want to do. is to be a little bit of each but. can be predominantly one or the
    other, or. Equal equal parts. make sense. Make sure I get the gradebook hooked
    up properly. I think i've got the. engagement with meetings set up properly now
    so they come up to 10. For the total mark. is a bit of a. country like extracting
    One way is to be able to do it one way and I couldn't find that way to do it and
    then. I. I was told about another way that. seems to work so we'll see that problems
    been solved. For now. Any pending your. results obtained through that setup and
    great book.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Activity code.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. yeah. I think that was not intended for everybody. Okay, so we'll talk
    about the project that more. On Tuesday okay. Since we're out of time for today.
    Any other questions or concerns. Okay, seeing Nanos say goodbye for today thanks
    for your attention and your patience as my scribbling and rambling. And we'll
    see you on Tuesday. Take care have a good weekend. hi there, yes, Edward with
    innovation innovation hi hey yet some single dishes a few days ago, did you get
    looked after, no. Not it's not a large number of shingles the spot, where they
    came off the roof is seems to be covered by snow down yeah kind of put a hinder
    on everything we're doing. we're opening it back at it next week, though. Are
    you wanting us to take a look at it, or. Well i'm not sure what the priority is.
    In terms of if this is important to do now we're gonna wait till spring or. Was
    there plywood showing was a building paper underneath it. yeah you know I didn't
    see myself okay. Maybe it's something we should look at just to make sure that.
    It could be there may be something we could repair next week, on Sunday on to
    help control the snow off. Okay, I mean I we were we're fixing shingle now and
    I have no concern that their permanent fixes this time of year. So I mean it is
    something we can definitely do this time of year okay.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
