- desc: Today, so. You can be the judge of that as well i'll try and be a little more
    chipper. Everyone have a good break. that's good. To. know. it's not all gone
    yet, but I was shoveling a lot yesterday. Still still watch the show too, but
    anyway. So I asked this question to the other students, the students and the other
    class. and So we had a chance, one of our. alumni is working at NASA on the perseverance.
    Rover and he's available to speak to us before March 29. or after April nine.
    So we're looking at having it in the evening so probably unlike Dave plumbers
    talk, it would be. Live presentation. Via live. question and answer will be recorded
    so also live question and answer. So in my other class, it was much more evenly
    split. And it was like 5553 to 47%. For before March 29. And the pole. Working
    i'm going to propose a date. i'm going to propose to our guest. Wednesday march
    24 at 7pm. So let's see how that goes. here. Oh smooth is unusual. rgb colors
    red green and blue. we're still using red green and blue is the colors as the
    primary colors when we look at hsbc. So what does he stand for. The Hong Kong,
    Singapore bank. The hsbc Hong Kong, Singapore bank of Canada. I think I have that
    one right. When I used to go to airports there's the ads were very prevalent in
    the jellies. Okay yeah we'll talk about the project. So you can think of. Most
    of you in 3D. Around the outside. it's an ankle. saturation is. On. The desk of
    the colon. or perpendicular to. And perpendicular to the value. Which is. Which
    is also another name for brightness. goes from zero, which is black. So you can
    see from the diagram. The value zero then there's just a point, so the only thing
    that can. come out of there is black with values 01 and go to the top of the Cone.
    middle of the Cone. color choosers. light is in the middle and then the color
    around the outside. wish I could. know in advance how to get the lines converted
    to. straight lines, because they could see that the last diagonal, but I do got
    converted to a. Line instead of my. character filled scribbles. Anyway, to me
    it doesn't seem to be. Okay. On. The the access to the Cone then we get we're
    getting blacks and whites and grace, as you change. that's too too small. Well,
    better baby. along this axis here. So if we're value of rain, this one. You get
    white. And, with no saturation but as we add saturation then we. get to the food
    that we add color. So this is. Fully saturated. make sense. We can just say we
    had read. up here it's bright red and then mixing the very red with. black. As
    we come come down this curve. So there is some comments about. The hexagon hexagonal
    colors. Well, not hexagonal colors for identifying those primary colors along
    the wheel. so far.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can you try writes a little bigger it's just hard to make out what you've
    got written they're just moving forward.
  persid: S01
- desc: Okay, thanks. you're welcome. hexagon. origin. red. Green. and blue. hope
    it is. One dimension, so we stand up the queue. To go. Read was at the top. Of
    the circle. Green. and blue. So between red and green is yellow. Because that's
    the next. red and green and green and. blue. And red and blue is magenta. 60 degrees
    apart. Once I finish scribbling this will do the password OK. We have displays
    recreating colors from black so. The screen. is black, to start with. And we go.
    We had red and green and blue some combination to get the color and so that's
    why we say it's additive. The freezing cm line. Which are these alternative colors.
    And the nexus between the red green and blue. We use these in printing. Different
    wavelengths so we get. The colors by subtracting from white subtracting white.
    detracting. Different wavelengths from white light to get the color on the page.
    cyan magenta and yellow. So it's red green and blue free if we give 100% red green
    and blue what what do we get. Right okay so rgb we get away. And in cm why we
    get black that's right. For some technical reasons. it's not great to have. full
    coverage in three inks. To make black. So that's why in printing we also have.
    K for black. So it's not a three color process but it's a four color process.
    So we printed with black black ink is below. So that way we don't have. soggy
    paper and. mighty black. So we're going to get a crisp plaque without. Without
    mixing those colors. That makes sense. Attendance before I forget. I won't share
    my screen i'm just gonna post it into the chat. Converting between red green and
    blue and. He saturation and value or he saturation and brightness. there's another
    translation, we can do. Our different kind of color model to have. And this was.
    This can be related in terms of black and white and color TV. So when. black and
    white pictures started appearing. On color TV let's see so black and white TVs
    or maybe easier in the sense of the just Gray scale. But then when the color TV
    kids came about so, then we have the three primaries red green and blue. So we
    need to communicate. Not just luminance or greatness. But. chrome information
    or color information as well. So this y UV. model is. Is is sometimes so. And
    the y UV is kind of a general form of it. There are many more specific cases.
    Converting. rgb to y UV. So, most of the information is carried in the luminance.
    So, in terms of. In terms of compression in different formats for that data. We
    can allocate more bits. My apologies for my. My poor handwriting here, let me
    try different configuration. luminance has has more more perception relevant information.
    So if we need to cut down on. The number of. This that we're transmitting or if
    you wanted to some compression if we convert. To y UV. kind of color model color
    space, then. we allocate more depth. To the luminance than the chroma. mentioning
    that, because of. Writing is not very good today. configuration is not so good.
    Day i'm going to try and. try and do better. So this particular. So the idea is
    why you see color space is. That luminance has more conceptual information, but
    the takeaway. Okay. I think i'm done scribbling for today. Oh do some practicing
    let's think about ways to. use this in a better way. Okay, so PowerPoint slides
    don't work so well for me either. project proposal. can make this. yeah sure oh.
    Oh. Looking at the chat again. I will endeavor to. to work on. My. printing so
    that I will convert nicely to text. On the sketches on the whiteboard okay. The.
    rubric is to give it. So it's not a. A very flexible structure so i'm asking only
    for a page. Good examples. Of the projects that I gave the other day was. colorblindness.
    Is colorblind. So you could do some things some of the questions. In P five. or.
    well. yeah you can. display or the questions and piece i've js example. And then.
    Content written for the web page, to say the background and. And the research
    that identifies. The questions on such a test and so on and so forth. So part
    of the the content that you're. Creating. or. He. You know, necessarily going
    through a. You know, designing the questionnaire. That you're. Looking at examples
    of questions. and creating an online instrument course. Then, so that that's the.
    So the content is. In that case. When you're writing subtext. And then you're
    also designing the web page. And you're designing. The element, the interactive
    elements. For the test. example concept. What do you want to accomplish with this
    project what's your vision, what are your goals. So. You might be interested in
    color blindness and. interacting interactive web site. explorer. You might say
    you want to explore the topic of colorblindness. and being very good point I can
    hear you can hear a bit to. The goals project. Such as it might be would make.
    A piece IP to. Create create an interactive website that incorporates. html. P
    five GS and. All those things into a nice package. So the ambition. is just the
    idea of having a. sense of of what might. be hard to do and. This semester. To
    talk to the content, already, and then the plan would be. To think about and lay
    out a schedule. For. project. Say you're going. To do this, html. you're going
    to do the research. For this, this online test and create the questions and. document
    structure. first, and then maybe you're then going to. pursue the. Questions in
    each in P five. So you can do this and groups up to four. If you'd like to do
    that. So you don't have to have the group set up beforehand, but just indicators
    in your group, if you want to do a group. don't have to do. Just indicate the
    names of the group members. On your submission and then we'll figure out the groups.
    will set up the groups for the next part. submission of this. assignment. Now,
    as I gone. over some in the cell phone you have more questions he can articulate.
    me. The reaction thing here. You can choose to do it. i'm not going to give you
    any more details. Yes. Not just any javascript. You might do something with. Some
    other things, but. focus and P five. If you're interested in, as I would say this
    new some topics to. to explore with colors that we've been talking about the different
    models and. Sorry converting between. The ones that we've talked about today,
    like rgb and H SP and. y Z. So one proposal per group. yeah I mean. So I would
    say. it's meant to be open, ended. But also. Some interesting things. Certainly,
    on the on the website, in terms of peace. and In. jazz have designed sketches.
    And we looked at. taken a brief glimpse at. Can. give you. ideas to go for inspiration.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah I guess for now that's good probably once we get into it will have some
    more specific questions, and if if we are I do, then we can address them then.
  persid: S01
- desc: sure.
  persid: ???
- desc: what's interesting. And then, what can you do. What did take what interests,
    you and. make a sketch or two or three. that are related to. to explore some of
    the interesting issues and to make them interactive. And might be a good place
    to to go with project proposal. And look at P five js website and examples and
    the generative design sketches examples. See kinds of. Things that are interesting
    and then you know. There is one we looked at for the snowflakes, which is a particle
    system, I think. Well, I think it was snowflakes the idea was. So you might look
    at a particle system and if you're interested in that kind of thing. That good
    you know you could do a little bit of a write up about that and. explore how they're
    used in different ways and. so on and so forth. So the idea is that you're looking
    at things that are. Trying to give you a. An open invitation to explore something
    that interests you. Soon okay.

  persid: S08
- desc: anything in April is too close to finals for me
  persid: S03
- desc: What is the password for attendance today?
  persid: S05
- desc: he didn't give it yet
  persid: S04
- desc: at some point in today's class, could we talk about what is expected for the
    final project and the final project proposal?
  persid: S03
- desc: hue, saturation, brightness
  persid: S03
- desc: Yes please
  persid: S12
- desc: huea, saturation brightness
  persid: S06
- desc: Maybe we did not get the password for attendance yet
  persid: S09
- desc: yep
  persid: S11
- desc: Black
  persid: S13
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Hey Professor, could you please write a little bigger? Notes are somewhat
    illegible. Having trouble following along
  persid: S01
- desc: Maybe if you could just zoom in. I think everyone should be done with the
    top stuff
  persid: S11
- desc: "Or maybe once you\u2019re done writing a section you could just repeat verbatim\
    \ what it\u2019s supposed to say. That would be really helpful. Because making\
    \ out the words is tough right now"
  persid: S01
- desc: "Sorry not trying to be pesky, just can\u2019t read what\u2019s being written"
  persid: S01
- desc: there should also be a text box option yes?
  persid: S14
- desc: ppt slides work good for me.
  persid: S07
- desc: "Apparently there\u2019s a way to convert handwriting done with Apple Pencil\
    \ to text, maybe this would be helpful for us all?"
  persid: S01
- desc: https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT211774
  persid: S01
- desc: Haha thanks!
  persid: S01
- desc: im good for the project
  persid: S08
- desc: Is the color blindness test something we can choose to do? or just an example
  persid: S11
- desc: it uses JavaScript like before yes?
  persid: S14
- desc: P5.JS yea^
  persid: S11
- desc: okay thx
  persid: S14
- desc: K sounds good.
  persid: S11
- desc: Could we have maybe a few other suggestions? Or some previous examples for
    inspiration? Or do you want it to be super open ended and up to us?
  persid: S01
- desc: If we are in a group, do we each need our own project proposal or can we write
    it as a group and just all submit the same one
  persid: S15
- desc: Anyone wanna be in a group? Email me natha20k@uregina.ca please! Would be
    awesome to work with someone. Or multiple people even.
  persid: S01
- desc: good day
  persid: S16
- desc: Thanks!
  persid: S05
- desc: have a good day!
  persid: S03
- desc: Good Day!
  persid: S01
