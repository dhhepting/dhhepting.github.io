- desc: Hello everyone. today. This feeling like a thumbs up today. practically the
    weekend right. The sun is out in the. snow is melting. So here's our student password
    for the attendance today. posted pasted into the chat. So, again. Please don't
    send me direct messages and I have to reset. My. chat. sent everybody. A little
    bit of a. nether. Because in the road. A lot along the road. I don't wanna. A
    bump in the road that. I suspect, though, that it doesn't say to everyone. It
    doesn't go to everyone. I just sent a message to sheree. So, no one else can see
    that correct unless the chat window is on my zoom shirt screen. She didn't get
    that in your chat.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah we didn't get the message are we.
  persid: S01
- desc: supposed to the student password that 103. yeah okay. send me a direct message.
    Just testing. to verify that I needed to have it set to everyone in order for
    everyone to see it. So Sharif made a comment. I can just type in type in here
    every time. And so. I can type in there every time. To get the message out if
    it's set to everyone. So just. A word of caution. Please don't send me direct
    messages, because then it just. comes up to works puts a bump in the road. Okay,
    so listen. doesn't matter if. Sharif and I have secret conversations or not. that's
    not the point I was trying to make. We talk more about peace, I guess, I have
    another. sketch. to share with you as a partial example for assignment to. we'll
    get to that in a minute. But I thought. I had some discussions with students about
    comments and. I thought. it's worthwhile to talk about the pseudo code programming
    process. Because I am a fan of Stephen will call spoke code complete. And he did
    I think there's a chapter in that book about. pseudo code programming process.
    So I didn't. see that there I didn't find a link to his webpage but I found a
    link to an article about using the pseudo code programming process. So the idea
    is the right pseudo code. As comments to begin with. And then, as we get the pseudo
    code. sufficiently dissolved and we can write the code around it. So, once a pseudo
    code is written you build the code around it and the pseudo code turns into programming
    language comments this eliminates most commenting effort the pseudo code falls,
    the guidelines comments will be completed meaningful. general ideas that are the
    pseudo Code into the pseudo code statements become enough that you can fill in
    code below each statement and leave the original pseudo code is documentation.
    So here's an example. This person gets. converted creating some code to put away
    on blog comments. cards can get up for it, but not down for it, which is all part
    of their weight. The weight is also increase based on the agent text length. let's
    say they get away to increase for point per month and then increase of 1.4 200
    characters anything under 20 characters gets one point decrease. To get started
    with a pseudo code programming process right down in the High Level that's what
    the High Level what the mess is supposed to do. So notice here, these. These already
    comments. In javascript or you can make a single line comment like this. We can
    make a multi line comment with the. slash asterisk closed, which is the open comment
    and then. asterisk slashes a closed comment. more detail. increase waiting based
    on the number of votes. increase waiting based on age increase waiting based on
    text length. And then we can add. A bit more detail so waiting starts at zero
    as a number of votes calculate ah waiting of one point per month. At the age waiting
    to overall weight calculate text length rating of 1.2 to three characters. or
    minus one point if under 20 characters. text length waiting to overweight. initializing
    it so. To be avoided, he says his comments, like initialize an end for the weight.
    That is correct, but it doesn't. It doesn't give us any information about the
    intent. So next step is fill in the code, so now that we have comments. We can
    have. grading starts at zero, so we have. We said wait to zero. And a number of
    uploads. we're adding. too late. upload to the comment, so I mean. The details
    aren't. As important as. So we're expressing what's the intent of the lines are.
    So here we. have one point per month. So we're getting today's date. and using
    some function to get the number of months happened between. The posting date and
    today's date. So it's not quite clear this from this comment about. When does
    it have to be a full month. Between the posting date in today's day to get a point.
    Or could it be like February 28 and March 1 gets a point, because there are different
    months. So then. We get the number of months. To age by the commentators spin
    around. And then we add that to wait. The length of the comment is less than 20.
    subtract one. Otherwise we. calculate the text wait and then add links. waiting
    to. The comment here comment about the sudoku programming process being done here.
    So this. condition is clearly available. At the condition for the increasing the
    weight otherwise isn't. Hidden inside that function. And maybe it's easy enough
    to explode explode. Express as an equality so. So if we're going to give you one
    point for 200 characters Calgary express that in code. Anyone feel like using
    the microphone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So, just to clarify you're trying to ask us.
  persid: S01
- desc: To use the pseudo code to find out what the code means basically for the text
    waiting.
  persid: ???

- desc: hello
  persid: S03
- desc: good afternoon sir
  persid: S04
- desc: good how about you
  persid: S05
- desc: good
  persid: S06
- desc: You can also type it here everytime
  persid: S07
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: I did not have secret conversations with the professor
  persid: S07
- desc: jk yes I did
  persid: S07
- desc: it shouldn't matter shareef if you do or not
  persid: S08
- desc: how to write condition to do text weighting?
  persid: DHH
- desc: I am not sure
  persid: S05
- desc: did you guys see any getline() or cin?
  persid: S07
- desc: weight = comment.Text.length % 200
  persid: S09
- desc: Would it be weight += comment.Text.length / 200
  persid: S10
- desc: textWEIGHT = comment, text, length /200
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep
  persid: S01
- desc: i cannot see the comments
  persid: S05
- desc: i see the editor.p5.js,org website with WORD written on it
  persid: S05
- desc: hue, saturation, brightness
  persid: S05
- desc: ^
  persid: S01
- desc: Don't think so.
  persid: S01
- desc: We could see the "Word" image but that's about it
  persid: S01
- desc: Its definitely improved. seems clear now
  persid: S01
- desc: Thanks, have a good weekend!
  persid: S10
- desc: have a good weekend! thank you!
  persid: S05
- desc: you too. thanks
  persid: S01
- desc: Thank you! Have a good weekend
  persid: S06
- desc: Have a nice weekend. Enjoy the weather
