- desc: Good afternoon. Okay, so, as promised a bit late, but I have We're going to
    use this link for the rest of the semester. So I've included that on the web page
    now. Take out the zoom invitations link. Okay, so here's our web page. Right now.
    So here's my schedule. Not going anywhere between I kind of sitting at the same
    desk one From Minutes between it's not It's not just relaxing. Anyway, We'll get
    we'll get it worked out. So it helps. Now I think that I've got the zoom link.
    Distributed So I'm going to take the office hours out of my your courses counter
    And these in here and I'll put the the input the office link. Here, I think. To
    figure out how to do that. In a reasonable way. Okay. So there's a Link here.
    Because You can click on that. If I have an office, our schedule, then I should
    be at the in that room. Here with the office. Here's the zoom meeting link for
    the semester. We don't need the zoom meeting invitations anymore. meeting today.
    So I had some discussion with It support about how to set these up. And they're
    trying to convince me that I didn't need to do it the way that I did it last week.
    So I changed it. But now I think that I do need to do what I did last week. So
    I think I need to have a forum for every meeting. So the idea is just to collect
    your thoughts about This meeting. Before the next one. So, So a change from what
    I did last on Thursday. Was too. So if I make some And to make make them open
    for comments are interested in proposing. Not 24 hours after the meeting finishes
    but 24 But midnight. As a day before the meeting of the day of the meeting. Planning
    is So banded Monday at midnight for Tuesday meetings and Wednesday midnight for
    Thursday meetings. Where we can review them. So have the Details of your assignments
    up and we can discuss them on Thursday. Now I think love start this week. I'm
    not sure about that, but I think it is so So there's a separate your courses.
    For These links there. There. Oh data. But there's not gonna be a mid term. Having
    the syllabus ready and I do mostly but I didn't get the chance to check the dates.
    So let me just show you What it looks like so far. All right, fix the links for
    the date the dates and I think I fixed the links, but just the dates need to be
    worked on. Let me show you that. I didn't ask consider doing today. Meetings on
    Tuesdays and Thursdays one to 215 Go until April 15 My offices in zoom and here's
    a link to my office hours. I didn't include the semester, if you if you hover
    over the link. You'll see there's more detail here because I didn't want to go
    over the line. For the if you just look at this one. That gives you Yeah, so just
    pick the semester. If you go to that link. Please, if you click on it, you'll
    go to the right to the semester. Anyway, And I have my office telephone number
    here. So if you leave me a message on my phone in the office. I'll get a text
    that you've left a message for me in my office because I haven't been in my office.
    For a long time. And I have to just check these Sections in the times for the
    labs. That's one thing I need to fix. And then the final exams. Well, I need to
    fix. So here's our courses. The first one in here is my website to support the
    course this semester. So, Description multimedia is use of computers to integrate
    text, graphics video animation and sound an interactive experience of course will
    introduce You to the different technology associated with elements and multimedia,
    you will gain an appreciation of the strengths of each multimedia element and
    be able to combine these elements into finished work. Okay, and recommended books.
    So getting started with p five is one I believe there's an earlier version of
    this is completely online. And then generative design some Sketches Visualize
    program and create with JavaScript, and P five jazz. So this first published in
    German. There's an English version. Now,
  persid: DHH
- desc: And
  persid: ???
- desc: Go look it up, put the link to the sketches that has go with the editor. As
    well. Okay, so those are things you Might find interesting as you explore these
    ideas. But not required. So the individual assignments. I should say individual
  persid: DHH
- desc: Can I do that.
  persid: ???
- desc: 20% so the project. And the project can be done with individually or as a
    small group. There 20% allowed work will be 20% So engagement with meetings is
    10% Participation is 5% And the final exam will be 25% you must pass the file
    to pass the course. Which is not meant To be a threat or You know that I'm going
    to try and fail people so I can make good on this requirement. It's just that
    the final exam is a way to Evaluate your learning for this semester so that That's
    what I that's what it's intended to support So I'm eager to Have your input about
    what kind of Form the final exam will take And we have some options. I think And
    we can discuss it over the coming weeks and then I have some discretion five plus
    or minus 5% and there's the research credit up to 2% We talked about last day.
    I love this online. I just had a question. What's the difference between engagement
    with meetings and participation like
  persid: DHH
- desc: How do we differentiate between those two.
  persid: ???
- desc: Well, so the engagement of meetings is writing Small notes to perform Making
    the forum posts. And Attendance, we will start attendance on Thursday. Coming
    to class and Participating in class.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And the forum opens onI'm sorry, because I was not here on the first day of
    classes because I wasSo I'm not really sure how the forum works yet.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so let's go and So any other questions about that. Any questions on
    this.
  persid: DHH
- desc: No, just also just have to question you could also can specify when the forum
    closes, because I was just wondering about the form
  persid: S02
- desc: One which closed.
  persid: DHH
- desc: When the engagement forum causes and your classes.
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah, so it'll close The night. At midnight or The day before the next meeting.
    So I had that setup for the for the Tuesday for the meeting to And then I changed
    it. BECAUSE PEOPLE AND IT support. That I could. I didn't have to. I could save
    some work. And now I'm not convinced that that's going to save any Africa that
    I can save myself any work. But the one thing I change. I'll change from Tuesday,
    where I said you have to make a post before Friday at Now for the Thursday meeting.
    I'll say make a post before Monday at 2359 So I can look at them before the meeting
    on Tuesday. And then for the Tuesday meetings, you can make a post before Wednesday
    at 2359 And the way that I'm going to do this. So there's going to be 20 There
    are 26 meetings altogether, but I'm leaving some slack to To get everyone started
    So I'll take the Top 20 In calculating the 10 marks of the for engagement. So
    I Should just go to the Let me switch back another one. Me. What's your cat's
    name Emily. you're muted. That's a good combination learning and napping. Okay,
    so let's go to the forum here.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Just a quick question regarding the syllabus. Would you be able to make visible
    to us case, we need to look for reference.
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah, I'm gonna post it once I fix The dates.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Oh, I see. Okay, gotcha. Thanks. You're welcome.
  persid: S03
- desc: I just ran out of time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Today,
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so I'm going to switch this back to Me because I have a feeling about
    this. So I'm just going to do it. I'm going to duplicate At 2359 I gotta try this,
    that we're not going to force subscription.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And equation for these forums. Each time you create a forum will get notification
    on your courses like through The email. Me at all.
  persid: S03
- desc: So it should be. Set it should should be on the calendar. Because I set a
    due date for But I'll mention that
  persid: DHH
- desc: Maybe I canSee what I can do together.
  persid: ???
- desc: A reminder about these in our
  persid: DHH
- desc: Meeting.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so the idea is maximum. So you won't get a mark, you'll get zero. If
    you don't write something before the due date and time. And to have you've written
    something that shows engagement with a meeting. And Also have one available to
    be if you've written something that doesn't seem to be engaged. So if you say
    something like The topic of the meeting was interesting. I had trouble understanding
    the meeting topic. So you've written something you've put some effort into writing
    something but You're not Engaging with the meeting so Let's give you one for that.
    So the idea is, so there are 26 altogether. So I said, the top 20 meetings top
    20 marks. Will go to make one out of give you a market of 10 for that. Okay, that
    makes sense. I don't know what makes sense here. Because I said these things.
    Getting a bit repetitive and I have to have something in here. Okay, so let me
    just check now whether this is in the Calendar, or in our upcoming events. Clear
    Yes, man. I saw your hand go up and then I listened. Sure. Okay, so let's clear
    enough. Still, welcome to use microphones, if you like. There's only 30 of us
    here. I think 2525 is not a scary number isn't So here, let's go through a semi
    our last meeting. So I meant to having trouble with my internet connection today.
    So answer restart and I was going to post a video of the following the entropy
    video About encoding. And relating the entropy to compression So I'll do that
    after our meeting today. And then you can you have a chance to look at it before
    Thursday, that would be great. So here's my Here's a summary. And I we found my
    wife and I found out that We thought, wow, all their dogs look the same. This
    is actually Elgar here when he was still more of a puppy. Should I play the video
    Travis asked Allah I'm not sure how much time is there, but So surprised to See
    that our puppy is Already a celebrity enough people are gonna want is popped renter
    Yeah, probably. There's a problem with audio. There wasn't there. Didn't hear
    the audio.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Now,
  persid: ???
- desc: So don't worry about that. I won't show you more videos. I just thought of
    it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Anyway,
  persid: ???
- desc: So here's my summary is a binary guessing game. Okay, I can make sense as
    in my scribbles Right. So we talked about, if there's only one card.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You
  persid: ???
- desc: Get two numbers for using what it's like if you're using one that we can represent
    two values. So if we had the one card here. You say, is your number on this card.
    Thanks for that tip about video Desktop idea. I'll probably not show very many
    videos in zoom tools we'll see So the question here is, is your number on this
    card. So pick a number between zero and one pick either zero or one is your number
    on this card. Yes. So your numbers, one that no you didn't know that your number
    zero. So it's not very exciting but shows you our goals. And then the two cards.
    Will be one in three and two, and three. So if we said no to both of these cards.
    The zero Said yes to this one, it would be One. Ever said yes to both of them,
    it would be three. Never said no to this one, yes to this one, it would be to
    Make sense Couple of things to do. So we did the example with three cards here.
    So what is the table look like with the yeses and NOEs if you make four cards
    and if you make five cards so So, what, what happens to this table. What does
    the table look if we had a forest card if we filled in the column. Yeah, so we
    have eight entries. Now, and so we make 16 of
  persid: DHH
- desc: Them.
  persid: ???
- desc: But how do we decide What do we do with these These eight entries that we
    have Can we do something simple to Do anything we can copy and paste or use our
    previous work.
  persid: DHH
- desc: What I like to do first call keeps alternate snow. Yes. The second follows
    this turn to know yeses two yeses. The third Nose than yeses and its New column
    then be a follow up. Yes.
  persid: S03
- desc: There's a pattern here. Certainly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yeah, the same thing. So first, go and do one thing. And then next one is
    0011 calm before the phones and so on.
  persid: S04
- desc: Yeah. So what I would do is I would copy These eight entries and just paste
    them. Below here and then You tell me if this is what you said. I think it's a
    little bit different. But then I would put notes in front of here. I would put
    nose in the first in front of these eight values. And then I put yeses in front
    of the eight values that I copied and pasted So that's just my own particular
    take on it. Yeah, so we're just, we're building out this pattern. So there was
    a comment about whether this is like a truth table. And I'm Not sure that I, I
    didn't I didn't get into came out. It seems like A circuit design kind of Idea.
    Instead of truth table. This is We're just we're enumerating we're writing out
    the values in binary, and then Under the V column. We're adding we're creating
    we're expressing them as as decimal values. So where is the truth table it say
    with the inputs. The whys and the entry is inputs and the outputs value would
    be V. And then I would also The wire and then there We're, we're we're counting
    in binary. And then it's writing them in decimal. Can I explain that better than
    it sounded To me.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Yep. Okay.
  persid: S03
- desc: So we talked about encoding a little bit in a Second, as well. So what we're
    doing here vs at the trick is doing some encoding. So we're asking the participant
    or the subject or the volunteer or the Whatever assistant Whatever adjective is
    most appropriate for asking that person to Go number in decimal between zero and
    15 when we're using four cards. So, What the idea is, is we're asking them yes
    or no questions. We're asking them to encode their decimal number in binary. So
    that, that's the surprising thing for people is, how did you get that. Well, you
    told me you know derivatives and binary, you told me your number a binary So that's
    If that makes sense. Only the only trick. Then, once people tell you the numbers,
    be able to add up. Value of the cards. So if they say Yes to the one card and
    yes to the four card, then you have to be able to add One plus four. And keep
    that straight until the end of the trick. Go one time I remember this not working,
    as I'm sure as a youngster who is Kind of Having who gets the number was not being
    truthful to me. Anyway, So the other thing to think about is What if we flip the
    card. So instead of having 1357 On the first card for Christmas. These three cards.
    We had 0246 on the card and how and things Change. Made the cards that way. So
    just something to think about. Any problems, but it's just Just a little bit.
    Different way of thinking about it. Okay, so In terms of encoding. So I took this
    definition so I took the definition from Wikipedia. I thought that was Traditionally,
    General to Okay, so we can know that we have. If we using example three beds.
    So we have eight different values. So we could use the eight values to represent
    The numbers themselves so 0037 would be the values associated with those Points.
    We could also use We could also Have different values that we associate with This
    is the encoding part It for 00 here. And we really We Have a number 28 For example,
    Much anymore. We have a bit color. Access 24 bits so If we have Eight bits to
    store pixel. Then we have 256 possible values for it. So we can either treat them
    as gray scale. As intensities between zero and 255 Or between zero and one. If
    you want to Normalize it So, Divide divide through the Value by 255 ticket as
    a Fraction between zero to one. So we can say that the percentage of Gray's it's
    in a black and white image or Are we can Say we have 256 wise. So let's create
    a color palette. So the fact that we have 256 values means that we could have
    256 different For color full fully expressed colors available to us. So we can
    represent 236 24 colors. I'm not sure if I'm making this better or not. But the
    idea is you can save some space because they're only storing one bit or eight
    bits, instead of 24 bits every pixel And we're just looking up so we just have
    to store one The power of 256 colors with 24 bits and the rest of the image data
    itself can be stored using only eight bits. So that's one way that we can do an
    encoding and there's some other ways. So we'll catch up again. We'll come back
    to that later in the semester. So then storing text. Ideas, you have to convert
    You have to come up with a system of storing the values like the letters A through
    said With some numerical equivalents. So for just interested in capital letters.
    We can use five bits to get the 26 letters. Or if you want the lowercase letters
    to then we have We need to add another good service with six bits. We can have
    6464 spots in our table. In her Her look up between lowercase, uppercase letters
    and And the code reason to access So it's 64 characters and we have Door for punctuation
    and so on. Then we'd like to add numbers zero through nine. And numerical operators.
    Plus minus and so on. So, then we've exceeded six So then we go to seven bits
    that gives us 128 Characters and that's what I'll ask is defined So let me show
    you. A very nice representation of the ASCII This graphic here from pre 1972 printer
    manual Credible character starting it Starting with space. An exclamation point
    in court and consign and Dollar sign and Percent sign and Season asterisks and
    so on. So the nice and some nice features of this are You can see that the numbers
    zero through nine. zero through nine. Are the lower four bits are zero through
    nine. And then if we know we're in So we just have to take those four bits out
    So you can do some bitwise operations to manipulate this easily So if you want
    to go between Capital letters capital A. lowercase a See that they're the same.
    four bits are the same. And then we just have to do a shift. To get Free shift
    right well anyway. So we just need to switch this from zero to one. And then we
    get the capital letters. And then the first two columns. Or Type control characters
    that Are not often use these days, but they're with us for Well, we have line
    feed, and Backspace. And the bell. So, some of them are still us but not so many
    of them. That helps to understand ASCII So what So what if you want to write something
    in French with axon. It grew axon and The deal and Any other see other oh So complex
    IBM tool. So there's no there's no room to put them in here. So what do we What
    do we end up doing. Or what what's a possible solution.
