- desc: Good afternoon, everyone. Okay, so. robotic Mars exploration. Wednesday March
    for us two weeks from tomorrow 7pm. So if you're on Facebook, you can. You can
    share this event and indicator coming or not. you're interested. In speaking with
    us he does his bachelor science honors in computer science complicated and 79.
    As Java with NASA is allows him to personally participate in putting robots on
    other planets. So here's the link to the zoom. registration. funny. I think. The
    way I can register myself. register. yeah. ingenuity, a helicopter that will try
    the hear me. Let me read it, because it's better than. perseverance will acquire
    set of samples and leave them to be right back to earth lady this decade, with
    the giant us EU mess mission. which the totality of which is called the MARS sample
    return campaign. perseverance also carries a small helicopter called ingenuity,
    which is intended to technology demonstration of the first heavier than aircraft
    there to attempt flight on another planet. So this lecture will give a brief introduction
    to Mars exploration and these missions. that's a depressing thought about Amazon
    drones. colonizing the whole is also solar system. I guess some good news is that
    Jeff bezos is retiring. So he's not directly steering. The company towards evil
    or not. No, yes, the fans and some detractors as well. yeah anyway so. I didn't
    mean to start a conversation about. Amazon, and so forth. I just want to let you
    know about this information, so this is on the car your computer science page,
    I think, somebody posted it on. I see triple s. This year's like to. share it
    with anyone else you you're welcome to. come here here's the link to the nasa.gov
    site mars.nasa.gov site. Dr Matthews profile. So much interesting stuff here.
    And there's also multimedia in. Some images to. share that. ingenuity. One can
    use and download. The original. 4k Y2K. Need for two megabytes PNG. So any questions
    or concerns from the other day, did you see my updated sketch. For the. doesn't
    sketches and I updated. again. Simplified it a bit from what I had originally
    and I cleaned it up. So that. Instead of just thinking about the events. and attaching
    the events to particular. controls. These event handlers. So this one just changes
    the toggle. So when I click on the canvas bounding box. Another one to calculate
    bounds. So that. That doesn't have to be done, all the time, and it has to be
    done when there's a change in the fonts. So what i've done is. i've. So this line
    of code. Associated Press. associated with the toggle function. With the event
    when the most is pressed on the canvas. That gives me a bit more control. So,
    and then for the calculate Downs I do that lunch here. In this setup. And then
    here i'm. Also associate the. The function, which is released on the slider to
    recap, then bounce up recalculated. You can see how it works. Time being done
    when the most is released. Okay. Any questions about that. shower at 330 today
    just two three to 430.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay.
  persid: ???
- desc: Let me go back to. This one. Which is going to deal with our next assignment.
    I just want to recreate an error message here. OK, so now. i'm starting with my.
    image on the website. on my website. http website. wwe to that siesta you're trying
    to see. So on the console I get this message. Much more detail there. Is a javascript
    console. console directly here. Next content. https page. Page loaded over https
    requested an insecure element. So that's an issue there that's what the message
    is. From. So if you get something strange. you'll get a console message on in
    the editor. But then, you might need to go into the javascript console for your
    browser. To get some more information. Okay, so. There may be made very obese
    include. In the message anyway. i'm gonna comment, this one again. On the. I O
    version of my website, which is https. secure. Okay, so we're creating sounds
    based on image. So function preload means. This is called before setup. So that
    we can begin. maker request for her assets. To be loaded and then we can do load
    pixels with an image. And then here i'm allocating an array. So everyone and exchange
    with the range. of experiences with race. Okay, so the idea is we're. store related
    information. In a way, that's addressable. So we have all of one thing. So we're
    creating a. business case for well. we're creating a collection of. locations,
    just to indicate which excellent which part of the imagery visit already which
    pixels. Read. So the size of the. array called visited is. The wait times the
    height. And we're going to make initialize to 07 To begin with, and shut up none
    of the pixel seven okay. So first you're going to create a canvas. Of with with
    times height size. So no stroke and means no outline. That ground. Is 192 which
    is kind of a grayish. And then the frame rate. For.
  persid: DHH
- desc: and
  persid: ???
- desc: Center the image. The width and the height divided by two. So there's a p.
    So then here, creating the sound synthesis. Creating an envelope. Which is. The
    sound of the produce, so how attack is. How quickly. It initiate and then UK time
    is how quickly or slowly it decays. And then the sustain percentage, and then
    the release time. Look at some examples of that in a minute. Set the range for
    the attack level and the release level. And then we can attach an oscillator.
    or associate an oscillator see. I see envelope. So we can choose between sign
    and triangle and Socrates and square oscillators. And then the oscillator aptitude
    is controlled by. The envelope. So, then, we start the oscillator. We have a frequency
    and 400. And then we have a sound recorder. i'm going to take the input from the
    envelope. Take the input set the input of the quarter to be the envelope. And
    then we're going to. create a sound file. and To set the record to record the
    sound file. setup so that's. The sound generation. And we start the. Sound recording.
    We start a blank canvas and we can we can go into the draw. So what i'm doing
    here is then. Getting a new X and y position to draw. To begin with, is said to
    be. The Center of the image. So if X is outside the range. of values for the width
    then we. Then we pick a new X. And if lies outside the range of values for the
    height. and weight pick a new lie. So we test whether or not that x&y has been
    visited before. So if it has been visited. one. I believe, beginning. starts at
    zero. This is another way to say. Yes, the X and y coordinates that we've picked
    it's already been visited then we pick. And we start from the beginning. location
    zero which would be X equals zero y equals zero.

    than normal helicopters to take off on mars.

  persid: S02
- desc: the screen appears to be super zoomed in and the preview seems to be very
    small
  persid: S07
- desc: is that intentional?
  persid: S07
- desc: 'no'
  persid: S10
- desc: So it takes an image and reveals it pixel by pixel. Sound is based on the
    color?
  persid: S06
- desc: Makes sense. Thanks.
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S10
- desc: usually red means high pitch and purple means low pitch right?
  persid: S02
- desc: infra red and ultra violet light. the color spectrum
  persid: S02
- desc: sry, its the other way around
  persid: S02
- desc: sorry, did I miss the password?
