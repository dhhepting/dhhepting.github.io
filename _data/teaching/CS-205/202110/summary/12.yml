  persid: DHH
- desc: I think the problem right now is that we're not in groups, because it says
    it. We can't submit because we're not in a group, so it looks like we still aren't
    set up rate somehow groups.
  persid: S01
- desc: i'm seeing that on my end as well.
  persid: S02
- desc: Okay. Seeing the same message I am out of every crew. I thought, if I could
    get rid of. This mission. groups. project which which project.
  persid: DHH

    on my screen. I think when you were scrolling through the list of names, though
    I think beside my name it said project and.
  persid: S02

    For you as well i'm sure. It was exciting to watch me. said. Your courses to correct.
    So that should be okay. And for the one person who submitted and I didn't see
    what was it was submitted. The original one. Please make sure that you know submission.
    place. So if if you have a. group same be working together. make up for. Students
    in. Each group. So if the numbers, they will be working together, making. Your
    insulin. identify the adequate number. magically. work in the same group sure.
    To make sense. Okay well. So i'm not gonna scribble today, I think. You could
    look at. Well, actually my scribbles from the past couple days we are good idea
    somebody is interested in the project. About. Australia, with different colors
    spaces, we talked about. Transforming between them. assignments. They can see.
    The text words. relax and enjoy. here. example. Specifying and. So this is a.
    See the. equation source code here so set up. So 100 101 50. To.
  persid: DHH
- desc: '250.'
  persid: ???
- desc: So we can try, so this is a careers are named after a. French. word. usual
    I. Design clients. Is a little bit about. So you can describe this a curve. In
    terms of. What control lights comdex hall. And then. So. Interesting feature these
    curses they all stay inside come on back small. mind. shakers and you can see
    us. Then. So you can see all the changes between them. So if we just connected
    the endpoints you can imagine being on a roller coaster train right in on this
    track this corner it's going to be revamping. If it's just if you just connected.
    If we have a. little bit more caring attaching them so that. So that besides that
    control oh not job. So the edges. were going in the same direction. Part of this
    lie on the same line. Then. We made. The smoother dropping the connection. Between
    the queries. Then we're gonna have a smoother. The speed may change. In our training.
    But if. It happens to be. So the segments lineup and the same thing. Then. that's.
    The best kind of drive all together. So we can talk about Caesar and see one in
    cq. Canadian schools. User that can use that. So you can see it not very long
    connecting here. soon. So much more. more tragic than saying. function.
  persid: DHH
- desc: picture again.

- desc: So you can see the. text commands. will create the. The pictures of the words.
    We can. install. You see, that saying the shoe and text and image on web. want
    to get the text out of it. Unless it's written as html it still maintains its.
    excellence. Then you can. extract it from the images. Like napa vector images
    and since. Since my channel. was the object. The vector. description of the object.
    So any questions or comments in the system in the ritual Simon. Where the next
    project. So on to give you an update of. What. we're alone, this is working at
