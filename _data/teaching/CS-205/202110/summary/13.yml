- desc: Everyone. Let me first do the attendance. Okay i'm sharing my screen now.
    Just to confirm the password. For the. assignments and proposal. So marks were
    just received from. assignment one. And I wonder whether. I might have brought
    up some issues. Maybe we can. help. assignment to from today to Thursday, perhaps.
    exclamation marks. yeah so there's a suggestion over the weekend. So if you made
    it. tonight. Change the other one change everything. And we keep the. said, in
    theory, keep the same dates for the other assignments. Okay, so. we'll talk about
    that earlier. That. The description of the assignments wasn't. That left something
    to be desired, even if we're from assignment one. Okay, too much vigorous nodding
    for that one. Look at this. again. things in the. In. The description, so when
    I say basic implementation. So I realize this kind of left. That up in the air,
    to make the connection between the basic implementation and my example. Of what
    the basic implementation required. And then. And then, a feature that extends
    the basic invitation in some way. And it's identified. And commented. Look at
    my example from the from the first one. Okay, so interesting example to illustrate
    interviewer surprise. surprise for a Min Max. Taken one of four values as a result.
    That part clear. Advanced feature and clear okay well. We can talk about you can
    talk to me about that. We can. Can we do. Not not for this one or the for the
    first two assignments, we could possibly. Change the rubric. So maybe the basic
    and the advanced or. Maybe experimental. feature. Those two get the same place.
    And then, and then still one one for the comment for the documentation. include
    one so he's the notation. So the bracket means includes the endpoint and the parentheses
    means exclusion point. Officially changed to the ninth but no other changes are
    made. When. Okay, so that's the next value. So we're getting evaluated 001 third
    two thirds or. one. where's the line between the basic and advanced features.
    So i'm having a. Public. moment of indecision about. me. man. Okay, anyway, so
    this was this example i'm. I said the probability to be Point seven five. Now,
    Richard I couldn't get it to be Point seven five because. It comes up. well. The
    slider and the range. surprise when I get. Using the slider to do this. let's
    see equivalent. 02 Point five. example. See when it's Point seven five and most
    of these. Most of the threshold, most of the coin tosses will come in this first
    category. Which is zero which turns into black. turn into like. A mirror images
    of each other. what's another way to do this. 830 this morning. Doing begin with
    fillers. teaming. Okay, so after some struggling. like a clear statement of the
    basic implementation. could even make this little. symbol. say something. More.
    Freedom, the den. guess, I wanted to make sure that. The concept of entropy we're
    talking about is related to information theory. Making a video is. Not about order
    and disorder it's about. About surprising. variability. So if we have no surprise
    that information content is lonely can compress it a lot. give enough detail in
    too much detail. We can rehash the first assignment then. You can have a better
    understanding for going ahead with simon's two through five. or two through for.
    A little bit different than some. Any questions or concerns. Why don't we leave
    a bit early today. Learning.
