- desc: Good afternoon.
  persid: ???
- desc: known as April fool's day. Technically pranks are only supposed to happen
    before noon. So zoom cut out on me a couple of times. I think it was before noon
    today in my other than our other meeting. To check chalk that up. assignment.
    The assignment that was due on Tuesday. There may have been an issue with the.
    For some, because I didn't have it set up to receive the same type of submission.
    So I corrected that after it was pointed out to me. That If anyone was. thrown
    by that. Please let me know and make. So you won't get penalized for being late,
    if you were if you hesitated to submit something, because it looked unfamiliar
    to you. As a way to submit the link to the editor. Does that make sense. Get that
    out of the way. Open here. So I thought I would. Take a little bit of time today
    to show you some works by Norman mclaren. Who is famous for mixing media that's
    a national film board. crying on film dry painting on film to create soundtracks
    and so forth. You won an academy Award for. neighbors which I think is here as
    well. called pixelation pii X la CIO and. is using stop motion live action photography.
    anyway. So I showed that because it's. More famous. he's famous for that work,
    I think. Anyone seen that before or a part of it. an explanatory video. About.
    This process. going on.

- desc: Sound looks like.an artist might picture it this way.musician sees it differently.The
    sound engineer has an oscilloscope to help him see sounds let's have a few notes
    in the guitar.And there's another way these notes can be seen.The vibrating strings
    set up vibrations in the air, which travel to the microphone and then an electronic
    device translates them into vibrations of light.
  persid: ???
- desc: This narrow beam of light is photographed on movie film and gives you the
    soundtrack which doesn't appear on the screen but let's bring it out of hiding
    where we can see it come on.
  persid: DHH
- desc: All right now give us that guitar again.So that's a picture of the guitar
    notes well, can you show us some other instrument.What else can you do.Cry again.You
    know that's a mighty fine looking voice wonder what you could do with my voice,
    shall we try it.This is my voice it wait a minute.let's hold that still and look
    at it again.So that's how my voice looks like every other sound it has its own
    distinct pattern of light and dark running down the side of the film.Well, if
    a sound will make a pattern on film a pattern and film will make a sound, you
    can even create your own sounds by drawing directly on the film.Norman McClaren
    the motion picture artist has been making some hand drawn sounds and now he's
    going to hear them for the first time, played on the movie on it and sort of miniature
    movie projected.it's not just guesswork the sound of any of these patterns of
    lines can be calculated the size controls the loudness a row of small marks would
    sound like this.Larger mike's a louder sound.that's simple enough, then there's
    the tone quality it's controlled by the shape of the marks this series of thin
    straight lines gives a sharp rather unpleasant.But these rounded sort of it's
    smooth it.The marks can be any shape you like and how about this, using the brush
    Norman tries a row of small triangles.These sharp angular forms, what would they
    sound like.The distance the lines are apart controls pitch with the lions for
    a pride a low pitch note.A medium.And a high note.Now, what can they be used for
    these hand drawn sounds well Norman mclaren finds that they are a perfectly natural
    accompaniment to some of his hand drawn motion pictures each movement of the screen
    can have its own specially designed sound.Making movies, this way the artist has
    direct personal control at every stage of the film's production sound and picture
    I planned and closely related to each other, as they are drawn.Now Norman is checking
    to make sure that each bit of sound is perfectly matched to its accompanying screen
    action.Finally, the picture and the sound will be printed together on one length
    of film and color will be added during the process.

- desc: doing some animation without necessarily calling it that. So I thought it
    might be interesting to look at a. An analog approach to doing animation and film.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The national film Board of Canada presents.animated motion.By Norman mclaren
    and grant Monroe.Part one of a series of films in which mclaren comments on demonstrates
    and classifies aspects of motion which the animator employs in his everyday work.This
    is motion picture film.And here is one frame of film.The difference between one
    frame of film and the next is the essence of all motion picture and animation.24
    such frames make one second.Here is a simple animation stand.The camera.The table
    top.The button which when pressed.takes one frame of film.The counter that keeps
    track of the number of frames shot.In how many ways can something be animated
    from A to B.Industry straight line.10 ways.hundred.thousand or more.Using a cutout
    disk as a symbol for anything we wish to move that is see the animator first takes
    a few frames, there will be no movement.In one frame from A to B again some frames
    of the distressing.The result.Another way of going from A to B.In two moves.Still,
    another way.Equal size, a ruler, maybe used the faint marks are called calibrations
    to find for the camera to see, they are visible to the animator who made us pre
    plan, the action rather than improvise it.With or without a ruler and experienced
    animator realized greatly on the muscular memory of the hand for the size of the
    moves.As cut out often such that calibrations cannot be used developing muscular
    memory is important.16 moves, this time from A to B.This animator develops speed
    in shooting for it helps maintain the feel of the motion as a whole.32 moves from
    A to B.64 moves, but only 32 calibrations between each she makes a move, simply
    by field.128 moves from A to B twice as many as before, and each move half the
    size.256 moves from A to B.512 moves from A to B.Each tempo has its own character
    or mood.Compared with the earlier frantic tempos this one is peaceful.1000 moves
    from A to B.tempos appear to be modified by context and association, for example,
    if this disc is associated with a large object, such as the sun, it appears to
    be traveling very fast.If seen as a tennis ball its motion seems unbearably slow.tempos
    can be much slower than this so slow in fact that the desk would appear stationary.let's
    just review with the range of tempos the animator is most likely to use.Motion
    maybe testified in different ways.What we have illustrated so far is motions main
    characteristic temple.All temples are part of an infinity graded spectrum.In conclusion,
    the size of the move is the animators chief concern, whether he is animating a
    cutout an object a substance, a person or a series of drawings.Part one and.
  persid: ???
- desc: Part two as well.

- desc: The national film Board of Canada presents.animated motion.By Norman mclaren
    and grant Monroe.Part two of a series of films in which mclaren comments on demonstrates
    and classifies aspects of motion which the animator employs in his everyday work.In
    addition to temple there are five categories, into which all motion falls, the
    first of these categories is constant motion.The one and only feature of constant
    motion is that the distance between each calibration is the same.For anyone temple
    the animators moves are identical.All the illustrations of temple in Part one
    of this series had equal calibrations and therefore constant motion.The second
    category is accelerating motion or acceleration.The one and only characteristic
    of acceleration is that each move is always bigger than the previous move.There
    are many degrees of acceleration.In this acceleration each move is very much bigger
    than the previous move.A steep acceleration.any particular acceleration may be
    classified as a percentage increase of the previous move.The first move.To get
    the second move add 10% of the first move.To get the third move at 10% of the
    second move.To get the fourth move at 10% of the third.and so on.If 25% of the
    previous move is added each time the acceleration will be steeper.If the increases
    50% of the previous move we get an extremely steep acceleration.Such acceleration
    accelerations if arranged systematically form a spectrum, ranging from gradual
    to steep.If the moves are shown stage by stage the internal anatomy of different
    accelerations can be compared.or contrast the single acceleration and the constant
    motion both going from A to B, in the same number of frames.The third category
    is decelerating motion or deceleration.When the move between each frame is smaller
    than the preceding move, we have deceleration.Here is a steeper deceleration.steeper
    still.There are other types of acceleration and deceleration, for example, where
    the moves get bigger or smaller by a single fixed amount and not by a proportion
    of the previous move.The result.Similar Labor deceleration.acceleration and deceleration
    together with constant motion can be arranged into one large spectrum starting
    steep.Each deceleration is replaced.By deceleration less steep.deceleration is
    now so slight that at the middle of the spectrum, it becomes constant motion.The
    constant motion switches over into a gentle acceleration.Which progressively turns
    into steeper and steeper accelerations.Without the use of these factors, the animator
    could not portray even such basic things as wait.Like.A punch.Violent punch.punch.A
    cautious.cautious push.A thrust.gravity.A bounce.Another form of gravity.perspective,
    where different tempos are needed to create the illusion of travel at a uniform
    speed.These factors are of prime importance in animation, no matter what technique
    is used.Part two and.

- desc: I don't recall how many parts are, but you can really. Interesting you can
    review some more than. final version of that sketches I put up yesterday last
    day. Good. Doing is. Moving the camera position. Around. The draft function so
    i'm getting. i'm doing the same. cousin air. Okay, so i'm. coloring from black
    to white. start out with black. Well i'm sitting still equal to. I divided by
    four so. black and goes to white. But the box is. Black outline. And the size
    of the box is also related to. The spectrum. divided by four. So i'm doing. camera
    movement cosine and sine. So i'm making. The camera. Change, based on the frame
    count. So it's going around in a circle. And X and y and zed position is 128 so
    it's out a little bit from the origin. Try that again. Let me change the frame
    rate to be a little slower. one. To open then we're changing the. Up direction
    of the camera well we're not changing it, but the camera orientation changes.
    As we go around. The y direction in the positive. So that's a little bit. Cleaner
    version than I had before. And maybe without the sound itself. anyway. So you
    could add some sliders perhaps to control. frame rate or something like that.
    Or maybe change the camera direction. Maybe go around the exit direction, instead
    of X, Y direction. And the XY plane pardon me. We could. write some sketches to.
    emulate mclaren. animation videos. as well. not going to attempt that today. Anyway,
    any questions. Maybe we can a little bit early for the long weekend. And I have
    an office hours at 330. Let me just check the chat upstairs really. Canadians
    working in animation I know quite a few.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Do you have any connections at Disney. They tend to not want to sponsor visas
    for Canadians, because they have Americans that can do the work.
  persid: S02
- desc: isn't there a studio in Vancouver.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And there is a Lucas films in Vancouver but I really want to get into like
    Disney or pixar animation studios. club penguin was NBC but then they closed so.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. So. Someone who did her PhD here in the 90s worked on a bug's life and
    toy story.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But nothing more recent than that I don't think for like you have our grads
    especially there aren't a ton.
  persid: S02
- desc: Well, I would say. Maybe. And I have a friend who is a Disney, I believe,
    is still there. I do have a few people who I know. And i'm trying to get some
    of them to come and talk like the guy from NASA it last month or last two weeks
    wait no one week ago, when we go yesterday.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Names I would. Get in contact with them.
  persid: S02
- desc: I was gonna say that it's not just. Not just that Disney or somebody I mean
    Disney, yet they have people doing animation and things. But they also is also,
    if you look at the credits for movies, you see that there's lots of. Different
    shops that do different pieces.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah.
  persid: ???
- desc: So this, this is a wide. I would think about casting your net wider than.
    Just Disney or pixar ilm.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yeah they're, just like the top tier of what i'm hoping for.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah definitely so. i'll try and. See, who I can tap for some career advice.
  persid: DHH
- desc: That would be.
  persid: ???
- desc: Good really appreciate that.
  persid: S02
- desc: Maybe have them come and do a talk about. visual effects and. zoom in for
    a talk about that yeah yeah. anyway. Well yeah. i'm dating myself a little bit,
    but. there's somebody who knew another person for the of our worked on. movies,
    with whether digital in New Zealand. I think he's a steam now. In Seattle. Never
    friend from SF you who. works at ilm worked. On the new star on the latest Star
    Wars movies. I think so. yeah so not to not to get. there. Maybe post pandemic
    the little bit easier to. Anyway, any other questions. Okay, so try out the. The
    new online text version of their response to meetings. That OK.
  persid: DHH
- desc: OK.
  persid: ???
- desc: I like seeing other people's responses, but if this works better, I feel like
    that's a okay.

  persid: S05
- desc: I wonder how many frames were in Disney's 1900s movies...
  persid: S05
- desc: 2112ish frames in snow white
  persid: S02
- desc: 1 hour 28 minutes at 24 frames per minute
  persid: S02
- desc: That was 1937
  persid: S02
- desc: pretty much drew each one right? tedious as hell im sure
  persid: S05
- desc: They used painted layers where background drawings were separated from foreground
    layers
  persid: S02
- desc: sure!
  persid: S05
- desc: thanks Payton!
  persid: S05
- desc: I wonder if Disney is willing to revisit 2D animation
  persid: S05
- desc: im sure with today's technology it can still be profitable without the tediousness
  persid: S05
- desc: Ball, "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
  persid: S05
- desc: "The last hand drawn Disney animation was 2011\u2019s Winnie the Pooh. They\
    \ still do 2D animation, it is just done digitally now"
  persid: S02
- desc: They still use artists to draw out the characters, backgrounds, etc. but rather
    than using paint for the final product, they use programs like photoshop
  persid: S02
- desc: The preliminary art is still done by hand by painters, sculptures, and other
    artists
  persid: S02
- desc: I saw this Netflix movie called Klaus which was a mix of the two.
  persid: S05
- desc: cool!
  persid: S05

  persid: S05
- desc: what would have been your position?
  persid: S05
- desc: if you don't mind me asking
  persid: S05
- desc: I would have worked in merchandise but I hope to be in imagineering
  persid: S02
- desc: If only they hired canadians
  persid: S02
- desc: soon...Wolverine from the marvel universe will appear from Disney im sure
  persid: S05
- desc: opening the doors for all Canadians XD
  persid: S05
