- desc: Hello. Just I had a call when. In between classes there and then I just. Get
    sorted out. today. me share screen. There it is in the chat in and on the screen.
    So let me just so there's an assignment do today. Any questions or concerns about
    that. believe that i've. corrected the. Have a couple instances where there were
    five marks and you are courses. And foremark. indicated, is for marks, but in
    your courses are the greatest set to be a maximum of five. So I. I change that.
    i'm the one that's already been work. So you can submit it within 48 hours and
    that's. very small penalty. hey. disinclined to change it.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Would you be able to just confirm what you're looking for for an advanced
    feature in this assignment.
  persid: S01
- desc: The description. More. detail there. Let me check something here. I would
    say. an advanced feature would be. to do something. In terms of the. interactivity.
    So. This one that I I linked. sketches I provided earlier, we talked about. difference.
    bootstrap. here. drag and drop. Some other ways to interact with. That makes sense.
    Trying to be funny. To call it music is the generous. rated better than then a
    dial up modem. Maybe only slightly.
  persid: DHH
- desc: anyway.
  persid: ???
- desc: So the idea is. It the setup makes more use of the other files. So an index
    dot html. So this is first of all, p five. i'm not sure if this current version
    is here. Talking about. The code. My code. Well that's a little bit I guess. it's
    not the way that I would do it. So here we are. And then, our style sheet and
    then. We have the link to the bootstrap libraries. 4.4 point one and I don't remember
    I said what number were at for bootstrap and then jquery. Because. Because bootstrap
    uses jquery and Popper. Alright, the first one is a CSS style sheet. And then
    it goes jquery. Proper and then bootstrap. The style sheet listed twice. Okay,
    and then also there in the header there's medicare the character says etfs eight
    which I. Understand now. And then heading. So i'm using. The card class. card
    with 7575 align Center. To. To unit margin and to unit. padding like background.
    Some my text. So if I wanted to write a description of. My sketch. I could put
    it here. And this is a container to hold. preload gets loaded before setup. So
    it's like an asynchronous call there. So this is where we associate. The canvas
    with the container parent from the other file. So we make a variable called csv
    for canvas. And then we say the parent. Of the canvas is my container so the.
    The the p five js canvas goes inside the container parent. So this is all as we
    talked about before. And then. randomly through the image. Until we. visited all
    the pixels. And then we're going to adjust the. parameters, based on the color
    of the pixel. And here's the function of place. So here's here's the new function
    that we didn't talk about before. Is. The window resized. So when we get a resize
    event, then we have a call to resize canvas. So we're not changing the. size of
    the canvas. So we're. reestablishing it as the width and height of the image.
    And then we're clearing the visited array. So we're going to start over again
    with background. grayish grayish background. More. See. Let me run it again and
    all. again. Just having things preset. There are some other ways to. You could
    do some sliders or other interaction. To fiddle with the mapping of colors of
    input from the images to. The way they mapped onto the sound parameters. For example.
    And so the. The idea of these assignments, is to. started with. Entry but then
    nobody talked about exploring. text and image in color. So. The idea that. text
    can be. can remain as text. ascii or UCF a text. That remains as text. Once we
    rendered onto the screen, then it becomes an image. And so, thinking about. That
    transition between. Texas data and text is image. And then. So we could think
    about. If we had an image of text. As one possible source of images. And then,
    how does, how do we convert. pixels in the image to. call this transcoding. To
    read one form and the other and then another. So we have we started with. etfs
    a text. So if it's English North American English then it's one bite per character.
    And then we capture that as an image and then. we're going to generally have more.
    Take more space to capture that image. As text. We have data again. Some different
    format. And then, if we transform. The image data into sound, then we get another.
    increase in the amount of data. Because what did we talk about the for the size
    or the amount of samples that we have. For sound files. So why did we want to
    sample it 44 44,000 times a second. yeah so we're done we sample at a rate that
    about twice the human hearing range so we're not doubling the human hearing range
    were sampling of that rate, so that we can reconstruct. signals, so we can we
    can reconstruct sounds. In the. Human hearing range. So, because we can. Because
    we can reach happening at 44,100 times a second then frequency, that we can do
    construct is.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 20,050.
  persid: ???
- desc: So that's. that's more than some people can hear some other people can hear.
    But in general that's what people can hear. So if we sample only 22,015 then.
    We can only accurately reconstruct. signals that are up to 11,025. So, otherwise
    about that, and they might be kind of a hidden message. So it's like what whether.
    Some signs of pebbles. If the fellows are too big to fit through the. Through
    the great. Little catch all but then we might also catch. A few that are that
    would fit through the great with just because they've. hit. The wrong place. or.
    They might not fall through because. He did the intersection so. that's the case
    where we could reconstruct that. Because we've got we've been lucky their sample
    it. it's My analogy too far flung. where's that make sense. Okay, thank you for
    that photo confidence. The next. assignment is about. Transforming sound to something
    else. So what can we. Can we understand sound and other forms, maybe backers text
    and so forth. So it's. A little bit like we talked about earlier in the Semester
    when. Whether this is, you know media or multimedia. So you can think of Union
    media. Because it's all. called binary data in the end. Just how its interpreted,
    so this these. Three assignments, in the middle here are about interpreting binary
    data different ways. I want to apologize for that my. My. unsuccessful efforts
    to have the doorbell play properly for you, yes. On Thursday, and then. Essentially,
    that was the issue with my. yeah I mean not sharing audio. The code from the reference
    page does work. Talk about. The concept of bitmap and vector. As it applies to
    sound. So do we have the frequency. quantified. And sampled. that's like a bitmap
    image. Then we also have the idea of Midi. Which is a standard. abbreviation for
    musical. musical instrument digital interface. So we can have. These notes. That
    correspond to different.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Excuse me.Different notes and the keyboard, for example.anyway.And then we
    can convert them.

  persid: S08
- desc: I stayed up all night finiishing
  persid: S08
- desc: yes sir please
  persid: S03
- desc: can you please extend the due date sir
  persid: S09
- desc: mine even has a nifty drag and drop feature
  persid: S08
- desc: What is the advanced feature you are looking for?
  persid: S01
- desc: Can you extend an assignment for two days. We have two midterms back to back.
  persid: S10
- desc: same here
  persid: S05
- desc: awww man I legit stayed up all night finishing
  persid: S08
- desc: it took hours to make the drag and drop work
  persid: S08
- desc: yes! if possible please extend the assignment due.
  persid: S06
- desc: thank you
  persid: S08
- desc: I made a drag and drop.  The program starts with an image but if you drag
    a new image onto the canvas it will update and start drawing that one to music.
  persid: S08
- desc: Everyone is waking up all night for doing their best!!!!!!!!!!
  persid: S05
- desc: I agree. I also have 6 classes and 2 labs but I still got it done
  persid: S08
- desc: "It\u2019s hard to hear you over the music"
  persid: S08
- desc: the music hurt my ears, not going to lie
  persid: S11
- desc: i thought my headphones were broken haha
  persid: S11
- desc: connecting to dial up, yes
  persid: S12
- desc: To double human hearing range?
  persid: S04
- desc: yea
  persid: S04
- desc: That makes sense
  persid: S13

  persid: S12
- desc: pitch is going high
  persid: S05

  persid: S05
- desc: when is the new submission date?
  persid: S16
- desc: none that i can think of at the moment
  persid: S11
