- desc: Just putting my coat on here to. Not enough installation here between me and
    the. doors in this position. Watch super bowl. Those two days. yeah I watched
    that. yeah time is good. This weekend from Toronto. I saw people from Tampa Bay
    in the news. not socially distancing and their celebration afterwards. And Colbert
    said that his. His answer for his response to that was Florida. I think that was
    the essence of the comment. anyway. So let me share a page here. For our meeting
    today. yesterday's meeting. Our last meeting on Thursday, so this is today's meeting.
    So what i'm trying to do. Based on. It wasn't at midnight last night that I did
    this. Created the summary.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: My. plan based on. Our discussions is to have talked about responses from
    to the last meeting. As a way to think about questions or comments. warm up to.
    today's topic. Okay. So, if your responses are captured here i'll. still going
    to include them for marketing. And i'll add them here, so the to the to the record
    if if the. answer as required. Anyway, so a couple. So let's spend some time talking
    about P five js and the assignment today. Make sure it's clear about that. And
    I can adjust the due dates if needed. As far as promised when I signed them a
    couple weeks ago. When I talk about the last anyway. Okay, so I just went. So
    i've done some editing on the comments here. Trying. Chris said i'm trying to
    add my comments as in parentheses, but I didn't do that here. So I should have
    said, is a true. That. I should have put those in parentheses closer, I was to
    my comment. So good to have a great for simple renderings and vectors are best
    when you need to use. A large scale. So. I feel like that's probably true. it's
    more nuanced than that. So we're talking about. maps and vectors in terms of fonts.
    This is also true for images, in general, I think. So bit maps great for fast
    simple renderings. If. We have a small font or a small image. there's a lot of
    detail in. And the description of the. Evidence vector form might be a large larger
    file than the map would be at a particular resolution. So for for doing that a
    lot if you're using that graphical lot or that character lot is, as we do in fonts.
    And it's it's better to have as as a it's quicker to have it as. A bitmap. Because
    we're going to save space and we're going to. not have to spend the time to render
    the description into a into a bitmap anyway. because all of our displays of reusing
    or bitmap. For the benefit of using vector format for fonts and for images. Is
    that we have. The ability to scale. And we're talking about scaling to large size.
    In this description of the image will probably be a much smaller than that map.
    That mapped image.
  persid: DHH
- desc: But.
  persid: ???
- desc: Are the cases where we have maps revalue bit maps for large images. what's
    it what's an example of. bitmap. Being popular. With math images being popular.
    And a large scale. Going on yeah. Okay, so I just noticed a couple of direct messages.
    So please don't send me direct messages. I don't know if you're going to show
    up in chat or not. it's just. So, the reason is that i'm. I have, I can immediately
    send to everybody in the meeting of someone sends me a direct message, because
    in a set to reply. To you, and a direct messages. Okay, so, then I have to take
    that extra step and then. If they don't show up in the chat record, and I mean
    i'd like them to be used for. To be. available for everyone to look at. Okay,
    so anyway. Yes, so I just talked about very willing to discuss an extension for
    the assignment and we're going to talk about it today okay. I was looking for
    responses about when our. When our large kidnapped images. appreciated. and valuable.
    yeah that's what I was gonna say for photographs. So if you had a 10 megapixel
    camera or your iPhone or your android. what's what's the size of the images on
    those devices now. i'm not even sure this say well 1010 million pixels such a.
    masters or 4k now. so that I can remember the dimensions. The 2500 by. 19. Oh
    okay thanks kayden. let's figure out what that what those dimensions are. How
    many pixels that is. 24 bits. one. that's 200 million bits about give or take.
    Anyway, so. The idea is that we're. Really two key concepts of sampling and quantization.
    So the. Is a 4k image size so that's the spatial sample. that's how many samples
    you're taking in a. In a. In the space. And if they're equally spaced. Which is
    what we'd like to do we're dividing up in the area. into 3840 by 2160. So the
    aspect ratio is 16. By nine. Everyone familiar with the term aspect ratio. So
    that's. that's the width to the height. So if we had. A region in space that was
    nine centimeters. I and 16 centimeters wide. That would be. That we could sample
    that. and create a 4k image.
  persid: DHH
- desc: With.
  persid: ???
- desc: These dimensions so. For example, I mean it doesn't have to be. It could be
    16 meters by nine meters. And if we have if we start out with that shape. Or that
    the dimension of rectangle. Then we're going to get pixels equally equally just
    equal distantly. spaced equal distantly. Anyway, so that that's so interesting.
    So we're going to sample. Anyway, getting. Over too much into sampling here, perhaps.
    Okay, so let me. Think I didn't get everything. published. we're going to spend
    the bulk of the time on the p five js assignment. Let me finish going through
    these questions so. i'm curious why the question mark why we might identify it
    as an eight bit question mark. And I didn't have a. So I apologize for the. tiny
    resolution here. So I thought, maybe it was. Eight bits here so 12346 this is
    seven. So anyway it's my question makes sense. So in the response to me they said
    we discussed an eight that question mark. Any thoughts about. Why, we had an eight
    bit question mark why it was called an eight bit or why we might talk about it
    as an eight this question mark. The talks with a bit depth, which is what we were
    just describing. Here, in a sense. So, instead of just having a single bit represent
    that each. pixel. In each location, they were sampling. Storing either zero or
    one you can store eight bits that gives us between zero and. As a value associated
    with each sample so. The sampling is this is the X and y are the width and height.
    Of the image. And the quantization is a number of bits restoring. Using the story
    to sample. That makes sense. So if you want to anti aliasing a question mark or
    any character. We need to have more than. one. So we can do better with to better.
    could do a little bit too, because there was three best and all the way up to
    48 that's. That makes sense. And the reason why. It gets better is because we
    can create a gradient. Of colors for each. That we can assign to each pixel. Each
    sample. So we don't just have black or white, we have shades of grey or shades
    of. Whatever colors, we need to represent. To create. A blurred effect. Again,
    please no direct messages. So whatever whatever however greatest screen resolution
    we have. we're always going to decide we're always going to end up with deciding
    pixels turned. Up get to be on or off. And that'll be fine I won't be so bad for.
    The resolution as intended and. Then we can always do. aliasing. TIM to make up
    for the. Unlimited sampling capacity. So we can't sample any further any lower
    than. and any lower than these values here that are indicated in the. question
    mark shape here the seven. samples in the question mark, so we can't represent
    them any with any can subdivide them to make them smoother. But what we can do
    is assign. us. Around. So for make these. Four on. Seven samples here at seven.
    In the shape. But then we're also assign. A fraction on. Some great value for
    tango put black and white. The corner lens to have them be rounded out a bit more.
    So that makes sense. Okay, so. here. comment vote or the responsibility staircase
    and anti aliasing. So that's how that's a screen resolution, for me, so it looks
    pretty good. The face to face zoom in on that screen. You can see that the characters
    are actually done like this, so that's an example of. The application of anti
    aliasing. So we can take photos images. And zoom in and out. This isn't a very
    good interface for zooming and output.
  persid: DHH
- desc: You can.
  persid: ???
- desc: Like I won't do that, but you can explore that a bit more. Free zoom out on
    this one, then we can return to. looking good like the original ensuite one. Okay.
    address those things. Let me go back to. course, so we can do it i'll share the
    attendance password with you. Okay, so let's go to the. example that I have for
    the first assignment. So what are we measuring. Or what are we trying to illustrate
    with. what's the slider doing here. From observation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Increasing entropy.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah surprise. That means. So the density of the pixels is the same, I think
    it's just. visibly different. So if I if I set a surprise to be lower. than I
    get more the same pixels in a row. Or the images dominated by the same pixel so
    there's less surprise. So on the siders at wanted doesn't mean that. blocks of
    the same color pixel can't happen it's just. The probability is his. Last. So
    the probability of the same pixel repeating is high, when the surprise is low
    or the entropy is low. And then the probability of the same pixel is low and.
    entropy is it surprises at its maximum. So I haven't. done a very sophisticated.
    No i'm. Passing two coins. So what i'm doing is getting a random number for. cleanser
    because the two coins so i'm. surprise. Now. So here i'm defining the slider so
    the surprise sliders of using a create slider. now say it goes from zero to 100
    and the. default settings 50. So that's the guy that will be returned. So the
    the most The surprise cider can return is 100. So 100 divided by 200 is point
    five. So what what is the effect of. Testing this against Point five. So it's
    like. It will, when I have this. set to maximum. So it gets 100 value. Then. And
    the surprise in the function will be 0.5.
  persid: DHH
- desc: what's the range of values for the random function for coin zero and one.
  persid: S02
- desc: And between zero and one.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay, so is that why you have it set to a Max of point five, then.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah.
  persid: DHH
- desc: 50% probability for each.
  persid: S02
- desc: yeah. In the kit in this case and it's like the. The two coins are fair coin
    toss. So let's look. here. So they can either do 01 or two arguments is no arguments
    given. The returns around them number from zero. Up to one but not, including
    one. If you get one argument. turns around and number from zero but up to up to
    the not including the number. of arguments given an array that picks randomly
    from the array. two arguments have given them the returns. first argument, up
    to the not including the second argument. Technically, I should probably do. included
    a random seed call. So we want to make sure that. you're in the same sequence
    of random numbers, then we can. Give a. Different number or you can give it an
    argument for seed, so that the sequence is always going to be the same. So it
    doesn't say what value it uses proceed, even though that. We don't get. In other
    languages, you might say, give us give us a time, the number of seconds since
    1970. Make sure that it gets you know get different random numbers. doesn't give
    an example, it doesn't say whether it's good practice to random seed or. Something
    from time let's say. Anyway, so the idea is the random function that i've since
    i've used to here is going to give value between zero and. Up to the not including
    the one. testing. Surprise can only. Be up 2.5. So that means. well. It could
    be. surface less surprising. it's going to be here so. Let me try that again.
    So in my example if fluff surprising. we're going to see white pixels. predominate
    the image. Because the way i've set it up because i'm not testing. i'm not considering
    the other side of the curve. So. If it was. same point seven five. And the. same
    as if it was set to be Point two five. So there's an there's an example. Of a
    limitation that could be overcome in my example is. So the surprise could be.
    Because have a different value. Different. color predominate when. A surprise
    that makes sense. So we could also do a third coin or fourth climb, if you want
    to get. more detail. Do as many as you want. Anyway, but that's another. way to
    proceed with. With an enhancement. So the question is, do I have this example
    for this assignment or build something new. So I. Think that's just a matter of.
    degree is not me, you can say. To build something new. well. Depending if you
    use any code or any ideas from this. example. So am I, the answer to my question
    kayden is yes. So if you enhance this example and you. copy this sketch, and then
    you identify where you. change things. Added things expert. That would be fine
    and then, if you. want to build something new, then you can do that as well. anyway.
    Good. glad you're satisfied with my answer. Some other ways we can. Think about
    this. occurs to me that, in addition to. This showing the. The image we could
    do some. presents and information about. The probabilities. of each pixel and
    the image. statement here at the bottom that he should do a print, but I just
    want to show you. What kinds of things you might see in the console. So here we
    see. The accounts for. For 012 and three. set to the snacks and value then. The
    values of each counter approximately the same. not exactly the same because it's
    random number generator. slider. entropy and compression what's another way. So
    we talk about a lossless compression of an image. is even heard of run length
    and coding, I think that was in one of the videos from last. Few meetings. As
    an example. Another useful thing for the interface should be a pause button. Because
    if I. I stop this is not going to. Keep an image on the screen. So there's no
    surprise at all. And we get all the same diet pixels. So what's. what's the way
    that we can express this image in 400 pixels of the same color. So you can see
    how many white if we start in one corner. Of the color here is white. And then
    we go down 20. Times 20. And again see this 400 of them. And that's all we need
    to say 400 white pixels. So how many Bytes does that require or. Even if we say
    full color. That can be two bites. right because one or 255 values. More capacity
    than one bite. So two Bytes. Which is. Now anyway that's what she's getting her
    again to cheer. He didn't get at least two bites editor. And then two bites and
    then three bites for the color. So we could store it on five bites would you say.
    That seem reasonable. We just had one color to record. Anybody still listening.
    Any reactions. Any thumbs up. Okay, so I got a kind of there, so do you want to.
    not making sense.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So it was white and 400 pixels would it just be like the coding result for
    white and then 400 and your next slot. Or how would you represent it.
  persid: S03
- desc: yeah. So we don't we're not thinking. format, particularly so we just want
    to say color and then the clearances, so we are.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Okay yeah so that makes sense I.
  persid: S03
- desc: think he was sketching something that I thought better of it. Okay, so that's.
    A little bit more. scale we have. very surprising. Possibility a compromise. How
    many different kinds of runs are there. Well, I don't want to tell you what to
    do exactly. Let you explore a little bit more, but. And it wouldn't make sense
    to. Because you'd have. to bite. The length of the run, even when there's no run.
    So there's another issues there so maybe we don't want to store more than. You
    want to use one bite to store ran so, then we can store up to 255. rented up to
    255 and the same color. Does that make sense. printing is slowing down things.
    refresh. that's what happens, we change the frame rate from. From one to 10. let's
    see if I can do. Alright So here we have the setup function. The canvas. And the
    pixel and the slider. And the set of pixel density to one. And the frame rate.
    So I think if I do. Looking. So that's the part that's the frame rate that the.
    process england's to support. The Auto refresh on and it'll catch console see
    different errors here. There are problems so. If you're doing this in your own
    browser, then you can just open the. javascript console to see. let's see So if
    you want to view. So this is for chrome developer tools. Right, you see that.
    Are you seeing my menu come down. Or is that hidden from you. Anyway, so the under
    review there's developer, and then there's this selection between view source
    developer tools javascript console and. This is also javascript from our events.
    We put javascript console. Okay, so that. We can make this a little more. friendly
    to look at. Okay, so this is the. This is the. javascript console from chrome.
    So that can be more helpful perhaps at times. anyway. So the console on in the
    editors is reasonable, I think, for many things. as well. So the setup function
    is executed once the start. And then the draft function is what gets. called each
    time.
  persid: DHH
- desc: it's.
