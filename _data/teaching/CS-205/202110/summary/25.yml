    back with a vengeance. third wave of winter. anyway. watch a short video. And
    then. Another sketch. So this is from a few years ago, but. I think it has some
    interesting issues we can talk about. windows hiding the player controls, I guess,
    I can. Do. Now.
  persid: DHH
- desc: yep.

- desc: Looking at here is a reproduction of a digital photograph of the Solomon guggenheim
    museum, where I work on fifth avenue in 89 street in New York City. it's just
    one of the millions of digital and actual photographs that had been produced of
    this iconic frank Lloyd Wright designed building and according to Google sites
    map of photo heat mapping technology it's also one of the most photographed sites
    in the world.
  persid: S02
- desc: The image you're looking at here is the interior of the museum during one
    of our exhibitions in the summer of 2013 of the light and space artist James terrelle.
    As someone who actually saw this exhibition on my own, I was physically there,
    I can tell you the reproduction of the actual work of art does no justice to the
    actual experience when you're actually in the museum.
  persid: DHH
- desc: And for the artist he's described his work as non vicarious any reproduction
    of that image is less than the experience itself and for that reason he requested
    that visitors not take pictures inside the museum.He did not want mobile devices
    glowing mobile devices to impede your experience of this light experience within
    the museum.The results of our social media campaign, however, indicated the exact
    opposite, with more than 5000 photos on instagram shared with the hashtag terrelle
    and it was also the most instagrams exhibition in our history.This prove that
    obviously visitors come to museums, to look at pictures and they also want to
    take pictures and in the age of the Internet, they put these pictures online on
    social media sites.The images are seeing here are the images on instagram that
    have been illegally uploaded and disseminated.Despite our warnings and as someone
    who manages social media for the new vm i'm interested in what it means to have
    these digital devices inside galleries.Inside these educational spaces and how
    the digital reproduction of these images changes the way we look at our and the
    way we learn about our.So does the rapid digitization of images, reduce the experience
    you have is it reductive or does it expand the meaning of that experience and
    object in an entirely new form there by reaching millions of people outside of
    the physical space, who could never physically come to the museum.In the history
    of art, the work of art is now a social object in the future, I predict that the
    the digitization of the work of art will completely change the physical object.And
    D materialize it and turn it into a social object completely defined by the conversation
    happening around it, rather than the experience itself.for everyone who came to
    the museum their first interaction with art was completely digital they saw it
    online they saw it on their phones or they saw it, because their friends were
    there and they shared it online.This is an image of the interior of the museum
    without the James trial installation, you can see that visitors are there with
    their mobile phones.they're taking pictures and not only are they taking pictures
    of art they're taking pictures of themselves within these spaces, so in the pre
    digital photography era, the message was this is what i'm seeing I have seen and
    today the message is I was there I came I saw and I sell food.So when someone
    takes an image and puts it online they're contributing to a digital economy.In
    the age of the Internet, when a piece of content is shared online, the value of
    that content increases, not only for the museum and the person, but the world
    at large, so the more you share the, the greater the value of that content.And
    why do we share this activities all ingrained within our brains social media sites
    are predicated on the idea of positive reinforcement.Every life follow every comment
    triggers a dose of serotonin in our brains, which is the chemical that makes you
    happy.And, like any pleasure seeking activity, the more you share the more you
    actually become happy, the more you're addicted so social media addiction is also
    a real phenomenon that impacts, all of us on a global scale.So, according to the
    Q Internet research Center 74% of Internet users within the United States are
    now on social media.On a global scale, the population of the number of people
    who use Facebook, is now more than the number of people who live in China and
    India.Globally, Apps such as whatsapp wechat linkedin are now surpassing the population
    of the United States, and this is followed by instagram Twitter and snapchat who
    aren't even far behind so among all of the Internet users 54% of them post original
    photos or videos that they take themselves.47% of them repost photos or videos
    that they find online on social media sharing.On instagram alone 70 million photos
    are posted per day.And this is all coming at a critical mass, because within the
    last two years we've produced 90% of the world's data.So the question of technology
    and what it means for the art object isn't new to the history of art or the study
    of our.In 1936 the German art critic Walter Binyamin wrote in his seminal essay
    the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction.That that which withers
    in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of a work of art his morning
    was a warning about fear.The fear of reproduction, the fear that cameras, even
    in such an early stage in the history of photography cameras were.impeding your
    view of actually experiencing the object.So the idea of visitors making images
    inside galleries, is also not new Visitors have been sketching inside museums
    for years and they've been taking pictures with regular cameras, not just mobile
    devices.So this is a photograph by the photographer I Fred eisenstaedt who's a
    Martha martha's vineyard local have two teenagers sketching within the galleries
    of the Toledo, museum of art in the 1930s.Also, not new, is the way we use art
    to communicate very common principles and ideas throughout the history of art.art
    is there to ask some of life's most difficult questions, who are we How did we
    get here and what does it all mean.For Vincent Van Gogh he examine himself through
    self portraiture.Today that act takes in form of selfies, and these are selfies
    that visitors have taken in front of Vincent Van Gogh self portraiture.Monet is
    most known for his landscapes and fascination with light through abstract painting,
    and today I would argue, this is no different than our desire to express and represent
    the sunsets or sunrises to seeing on instagram.season was interested in still
    life painted food and apples, for his entire career.And today that contemporary
    interpretation is what you see when you search for food porn on instagram.So what's
    the difference between the images, you see online and the images that you see
    in museums.For centuries, museums, have been an authority when it comes to the
    interpretation of art artists art movements and all the intellectual content that
    is surrounded by that individual work of art.In the traditional publishing model
    museums, are the experts that disseminated content and probably one of the last
    culturally acceptable institutions that can dedicate resources to tremendous amount
    of research.But the Internet today is now a two way stream of information anyone
    has permission to upload images online edit articles on Wikipedia.We used to trust
    museums in the way that we trust dictionaries and encyclopedias but, in the age
    when Wikipedia is now eclipsing the encyclopedia do museums still matter.The reality
    is, we live in a Google worldview.So when you search for an image online you're
    searching on Google and trying to find the you know quickest way to to find what
    you're looking for what happens when the museum that owns that object isn't there
    and it's vanished within the history part from a digital perspective.So case in
    point, this is a painting by kandinsky in the guggenheim collection the guggenheim
    owns more than 150 works by this artist, more than any other artist.In the world,
    but when you do a quick Google search you type in kandinsky you see a range of
    images with varying colors and crops, many of which are incorrect you see no images
    within the top results that are from our website.And this isn't just our museum
    take a look at starry night, which is in the Museum of modern art collection,
    also by Van Gogh.you'll see that none of the top images are actually from moma.org.Again,
    the iconic Mona Lisa which you'll see in person in the loop completely vanishes
    from a digital perspective because none of the images, you see, on Google are
    actually from the live website.So why is it that, in the age of mechanical and
    Internet and the Internet.Why is it that museums have essentially fallen off the
    face of the earth it's because of the notion of fear the fear of reproduction,
    the fear of copyright to fear of artists is states and what's going to happen
    if we allow our information to go online and become disseminated.And if there's
    one message from my talk today it's fear not.In the age of the Internet, we have
    only something to gain by creating access opening up access to photography opening
    up access to our intellectual content and making these images available for the
    public.i'm often asked, will the digital experience and the digital representation
    of the museum online through social media.Ever replace the onsite physical experience,
    just because we're posting images for instagram we have millions of followers
    will that ever replace the actual experience of people coming to the museum.and
    going back into the James terrelle exhibition you'll see that this exhibition
    with an incredible digital footprint author brought in over 420,000 visitors who
    wanted to come to the museum to see it for themselves because they saw it on instagram.So
    the question remains we're living in an age of unprecedented access to art because
    of the Internet, but what is the role of the museum within this narrative.Do we
    risk the social media sites and the immense amount of data that's being uploaded
    online images shared sometimes incorrectly without the proper attributions without
    captions without any of the didactic materials that's associated with it.Do we
    risk social media essentially driving the course of art history, as is that OK.So
    the task today remains that we have to reclaim our job as the authority and as
    the expert within this Google worldview.Through making our images available online
    through opening up access through uploading our textbooks and catalogs and making
    this information free for everybody on the Internet.we're opening up the opportunity
    for anyone in the world, with an Internet connection to learn about art, which
    is essentially the mission of the museum to.help you look at pictures and interpret
    what they mean and how they create meaning within your life so by opening up access
    we open up the discourse for art and we can lead that discourse and we open up
    visual literacy for all thank you.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay, so there's the video for today. Any thoughts about that before we get
    into our discussion that are. More class related. yeah We talked with aspect ratios
    of images. So the technically thinking about. Making sure the samples are. Equally
    spaced an x and y to make. keeps the perspective. This is important to keep. To
    not to crop, the images. And the cropping. The tools, the power as a cropping.
    tools to. Change the. meaning. anyway. So I would say let's talk about on Thursday,
    the final exam. So go through a review and. Then you can talk about questions
    and all those. All those things okay. All right. Any thumbs up perhaps.
