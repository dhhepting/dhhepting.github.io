- desc: attendance. here. We have the assignment do today. Any questions or concerns
    about that. emailing me about the problem is OK. Class I realized after that.
    This is not. Here i'll just change this one. So, even though the documentation
    seems like this would be a great way to do this. Is. A lot of shortcomings. Q
    amp a forum. seen a doesn't have. Starting type starting date for the question.
    So this way it relies on me to ask the question. But after the meeting because
    they don't want people to answer for the question before the meeting. So. clicking.
    I didn't change the due date but I changed the cutoff date. And rate in a response
    there. create a sample. test assignment for this meeting. I don't want to do it
    here, I want to do it. i'm not. Talking as a blank screen.
