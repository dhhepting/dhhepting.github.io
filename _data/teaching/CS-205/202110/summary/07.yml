Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Good afternoon. I think I didn't have my microphone switched on my desktop
    anyway good afternoon. Already for. starter February. She was a little nicer today,
    then at the end of January so. Take that for. So this is. All the assignments.
    Straightforward experimentation with P five js. And then. Projects It can be done,
    individually or. small group of up to four. you'd like to work with somebody for
    that. So the idea is to create a web based. interactive presentation, so they
    can be some mix of. Research and implementation or. Writing and coding. So one
    that I, an example of a project that was done in the past was. color blind. So
    the web page has some details about the. color testing for color blindness and
    then some questions. That were done in P five. So that was all integrated into
    a web page. So, as we get further along. So suggested the project proposal in.
    Three weeks from Thursday. After the break. And then do on the last day of class.
    Okay. different ways to. To make better use of your courses. Because I asked the
    question. zoom the zoom meeting and. Feedback feedback into your courses, but
    then that was. decided that pulling this prefer to doing that. trying to pull
    here. So you can sort of see my. stack of windows here from zoom. yeah. I think
    that's a bug not a feature. Because they're all. Let me pull but then it puts
    the other windows in front of it. i'll put in other as well, but i'm not sure
    what other is yet. here's me trying to find the SAVE button to click on. There
    we go. So it's interesting. I found because my reason for. Trying to your courses
    feedback was that responses could be persistent outside of. The zoom meeting.
    But people seem to like the idea of. It was oh OK, so now the zoom project kind
    of taking off. For more people to vote so we'll see whether. that's okay one more
    person to vote. Okay, seven loaded. Okay anyone brave enough to tell me what the
    other. option would be. Okay, so there was kind of a. Preference okay. appreciate.
    In the cases when. they're there to be I mean. that the option is. The question
    is clear ahead of time. i'll set them up ahead of time. more detail later on.
    I don't want. It caught up in that moment. Okay, so. People are interested in
    important details like what's the password for. posting media. So without me trying
    getting to transcribe them into a summary. About posting them in on the page,
    so you can access and. They wouldn't be publicly accessible and dropbox but, so
    the audio recording. And the chat transcript and the audio transcript I could
    post them as raw. unedited and filtered. MEDIA and then. I would use those to
    then create a summary. Okay. One block here. updates and so on, since you last
    logged in. So, to me, the recent this recent activity is a good summary cooking
    on full report of recent activity so you're not quite so useful because it has
    all the headings. Whereas, this is just. So important things have changed so when
    I bought when I update things. They would appear here. And while i'm here, I wanted
    to show you that. So you don't need to go into your courses to find my zoom office
    links. So here here are my office hours. master. And then there's zoom link. And
    that link is an email sends me an email, if I can arrange a different kind of
    different time for an appointment. And just realizing the choice of colors is
    not great here. But there's certain links as well. So you click on that, then.
    You know you look you'll get into the office. Okay. last thing we talked about
    in the end, to add that might be applicable here. So the amount of switching to
    other websites other website being my personal website. So the thought was. Possibly
    to. Add links to the meetings. Links for all the meetings like that. So would
    that help you a little bit of help. Did as an example for today's meeting. Any
    suggestions about. A couple people still to reply. One more person. Are there
    any suggestions about. How to go to do better than just having a direct link to
    a page. So i'm disinclined to put content onto your courses directly. From my
    years of experience, using moodle. This seems. I think the flexibility is valuable.
    don't want to be confusing and. seem to. become onerous to navigate to a different
    website. So if you have any. Any suggestions, there are appreciated. i'm open
    to them. anyway. comment about Hercules getting slow. So there's a possibility
    of moving it to the. server game. guiding videos and where to find them. Thinking
    of. Creating creating a page with the videos. or the other materials see where
    they. Are they come up. So thinking about putting the videos in one place, based
    on. where they occur in our discussions. Okay. Alright, so i'm going to stop sharing
    this. Okay, so anyways there's some things that are. Still hidden gotta clean
    that up but i'll do that so. they're giving you the links to the first assignment.
    assignments right, I think. Any questions. Let me just. Participation discussion.
    not going to do that now. I just want to give you a place to. Report bugs. notice
    your questions yeah. Okay. sure. I share this one, I think I did. Talking. yeah.
    So he's now. See how well he hates it is create spying on him. Okay. Any questions
    about. Please, we talked to her last day. If you can hear the cats probably tormenting
    him. as well. Come visit me. I feel like there's another scribble as I did last
    a new didn't make it here. Take your time here. Any questions. talked about it
    in really good. check what's going on. Okay, so the unicode decoding unicode video.
    Any thoughts about that. quite impressive that there's so many character sets
    included already and there's. So much room still to be. utilized as far as I can
    that's what I would say. Even was. 16 as encoding. unicode code points. 22 to
    the 20th is. You can see over a million characters. And I think we're at about
    10% of that with unicode 13. So this is the last room. mean some of the some of
    the details. Some of the characters aren't going to be. available for public use.
    But even not there's still lots of room to grow. Anyone see themselves cutting
    and pasting. Okay, so let's go to the onto the other video type my his life and
    type faces. Any any thoughts or questions about that. Okay, so what, what are
    the two distinctions between. We talked about fonts and. And such. In that video
    there are. Two things that we're dealing with. Accepting chat messages. well.
    Nobody. Not even in the chat room. Okay, thank you fit maps yeah that's one way
    to do it. terms for for. Usually, we have a bitmap display a bitmap. Working definition
    of bit maps are good map. Okay pixel. Any any any ideas will look at pixel references.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Sorry, what was that last sentence say.
  persid: S01
- desc: Each pixel is mapped to the display okay thanks. The pixels mature picture
    elements that's how the pixel is. The word pixel. So I can fix people. microphone
    is open, but. I I can't force people to be unmuted. it's interesting because.
    I just I can only ask for you to unmute. No, I did it man I turned you micah.
    anyway. Okay, so that your descriptions of fun fun cliffs. So the. unicode gives
    us these code points for characters. And we. transmit them and efficiently, we.
    We can use an encoding format like ut FA to minimize the. The number of this for
    us to send it right. So for using ascii. usual ascii characters. It turns out
    that those are the very lowest. Parts of unicode and we can. We can just submit
    to this transmitted one way, instead of four Bytes. character, a. New tfp. So
    I put in quotation marks because it's. it's the idea of a word that. We don't
    have a representation associated with it. necessarily. Because it could be. The
    number to those others. look more like an A. Change. would happen there got an
    A. That looks more like my second one, then.

Zoom-Chat-Transcript:
- desc: good afternoon!
  persid: S03
- desc: good! how was yours?
  persid: S03
- desc: it was great
  persid: S04
- desc: good Afternoon Sir
  persid: S05
- desc: I have a question about assignment submissions. The requirements say to submit
    a link to our assignments, do you also want a copy of the JS files so the code
    can be marked, or will the marker just use the inspection tools of their web browser
    to grade the code?
  persid: S06
- desc: I put other because I don't have a preference.
  persid: S03
- desc: YES!!! Zoom lets go
  persid: S01
- desc: haha
  persid: S01
- desc: I would just like it to be setup before class time so we don't dedicate class
    time to the setting up of polls, yah know?
  persid: S03
- desc: password for meeting
  persid: S05
- desc: "I have never used Zoom polls before so I\u2019m not totally sure how they\
    \ would work"
  persid: S07
- desc: Can it be setup so as you log in one can vote
  persid: S08
- desc: Although I like the idea of them so that those who are here in class are able
    to get the credit they deserve
  persid: S07
- desc: I agree
  persid: S05
- desc: what's the password for attendance?
  persid: S03
- desc: agreed.
  persid: S09
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: worked
  persid: S04
- desc: "I honestly don\u2019t mind having to navigate to the meeting site on my own\
    \ from the link at the top"
  persid: S07
- desc: I think what would help me at least would be posting the videos to UR Courses.  I
    find it a bit confusing where to find them (Summary, Plan for Today, Review).
  persid: S10
- desc: I just mean the YouTube links you post so they're all in one place.
  persid: S10
- desc: yup agree with you
  persid: S11
- desc: It will be good for us.
  persid: S09
- desc: That would be very helpful
  persid: S10
- desc: that would be useful. it messes with my head a bit to have to go to the previous
    day's notes to find the topics for the current day's class.
  persid: S03
- desc: Bit maps
  persid: S06
- desc: vectors?
  persid: S06
- desc: Vectors?
  persid: S01
- desc: Individual RGB components that together make up a screen display
  persid: S01
- desc: hi Mann, you're not muted.
  persid: S03
- desc: so sorry, but it showing I'm muted.
  persid: S09
- desc: oops !
  persid: S09
- desc: Vectors will scale up more easily.
  persid: S10
- desc: Vectors can be enlarged and maintain smooth edges vs bitmaps get pixelated
  persid: S01
- desc: using the power of math
  persid: S12
- desc: Thanks, you too!
  persid: S10
- desc: Thanks you too.
  persid: S13
- desc: have a good day! let that puppy out :)
  persid: S03
- desc: Thank you.
  persid: S14
