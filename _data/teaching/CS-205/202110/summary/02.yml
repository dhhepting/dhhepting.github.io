Binary-Guessing-Game:
- desc: Think of a number between 0 and 15 and I will guess your number by asking
    you 4 yes-or-no questions (I've added some links that explain the game in
    more detail). It is easiest to ask those questions if I have cards
    to show you, so let's talk about how to make those cards.

  desc: A guessing game
- img: 02 - wb-1.JPG
  desc: The game, as described above, works with 4 cards to guess one of 16
    numbers. In this whiteboard image, I've started a table with headings
    8, 4, 2, 1, and V (for value, but G for guess could also work). I've written
    in Y and N into cells in the table (Y == "Yes" == 1 and N == "No" == 0). If
    we have only 1 card (or we ask only 1 questions), we can "guess" from 2 values. Is
    your number on this card? If you answer Yes, then your number is 1 and if you answer No, then
    your number is 0. It gets a bit more interesting with 2 cards because we can "guess" from 4 values.

  desc: In this whiteboard image, I've sketched 3 cards which allow guesses from
    8 values (2^3) by adding the "4" column to the table. To make a guess, start
    with a value of zero and for each card to which the "volunteer" answers Yes
    ("my number is on that card"), add the value of the column for the card.
- todo: Next cards
  desc: We have discussed how to make 3 cards. How does the table get extended with
    Y's and N's if we make 4 cards and if we make 5 cards?
- todo: Flip the cards
  desc: We have discussed making cards with Y's from the table. What happens if
    we make cards from the N's? How can a guess be made from these cards?
Encoding:
- concept: encoding
  desc: Use of "a system of rules to convert information — such as a letter,
    word, sound, image, or gesture — into another form, sometimes shortened or
    secret, for communication through a communication channel or storage in a
    storage medium." (Wikipedia)

  desc: In this whiteboard image, an example of 8 code values determined by 3
    bits (binary digits). Note connection to binary guessing game. It is possible
    to have those code values represent their numeric values, but they could represent
    other things as well, like characters or colours. ASCII uses 7 bits to encode
    all the characters for North American English. Unicode uses (up to) 32 bits to
    encode international and historical characters (and emojis too). UTF-8 is a popular
    way to encode Unicode characters using less bits.
