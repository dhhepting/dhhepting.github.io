Binary-Guessing-Game:
- desc: Think of a number between 0 and 15 and I will guess your number by asking
    you 4 yes-or-no questions (I've added some links that explain the game in more
    detail). It is easiest to ask those questions if I have cards to show you, so
    let's talk about how to make those cards.

  url: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/a-guessing-game
- desc: The game, as described above, works with 4 cards to guess one of 16 numbers.
    In this whiteboard image, I've started a table with headings 8, 4, 2, 1, and V
    (for value, but G for guess could also work). I've written in Y and N into cells
    in the table (Y == "Yes" == 1 and N == "No" == 0). If we have only 1 card (or
    we ask only 1 questions), we can "guess" from 2 values. Is your number on this
    card? If you answer Yes, then your number is 1 and if you answer No, then your
    number is 0. It gets a bit more interesting with 2 cards because we can "guess"
    from 4 values.
  img: 02 - wb-1.JPG
- desc: In this whiteboard image, I've sketched 3 cards which allow guesses from 8
    values (2^3) by adding the "4" column to the table. To make a guess, start with
    a value of zero and for each card to which the "volunteer" answers Yes ("my number
    is on that card"), add the value of the column for the card.

    Y's and N's if we make 4 cards and if we make 5 cards?
  todo: Next cards
- desc: We have discussed making cards with Y's from the table. What happens if we
    make cards from the N's? How can a guess be made from these cards?
  todo: Flip the cards

    (binary digits). Note connection to binary guessing game. It is possible to have
    those code values represent their numeric values, but they could represent other
    things as well, like characters or colours. ASCII uses 7 bits to encode all the
    characters for North American English. Unicode uses (up to) 32 bits to encode
    international and historical characters (and emojis too). UTF-8 is a popular way
    to encode Unicode characters using less bits.

Zoom-Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Hello everyone. So I have a bit of a family thing going on today so I make
    it a phone call. And then we'll end the meeting a bitch. You might end the meeting.
    Early today. Okay. I do have a video of my puppy. Chasing his tail. Works later
    on. Okay, so Everyone's 19 so I'm not sure whether the other people in the class.
    Anyone, anyone lose your power last night. No. Apparently some people did well
    versed I had Some flickering lights. Lot of wind that Is scary for the puppy and
    And for me to actually mean it. Tree big tree outside the window here is Being
    bent So scraping the house and say, gee, I probably wouldn't be good if a branch
    broke off. Anyway, So enough about that. Okay, so for First things first. Video
    of puppy. I think Discovering that the occasionally discovers he has a new toy.
    There with him. This do that once your senses so short. Okay, so that's all These
    see Is about 12 weeks old. Now we got them supposed to be all 10 weeks old. Two
    weeks. And I Can week From this Sunday, which is almost two weeks past so He's
    mostly adorable. Now it's completely adorable but sometimes he acts like a puppy.
    Anyway, okay, so there we go. Now you've met him. Have you'll get a show you a
    video from time to time. How easy Because by the end of the semester, he won't
    be so so puppy like System of getting email before each day. So I'm inclined to
    think that maybe I will just create a meeting the zoom meeting for the whole semester.
    So we don't have to keep going through Emails, and then I can just post it in
    the calendar. Any thoughts about that. Seem like A smoother solution. To be paranoid
    so well. Just because I'm paranoid doesn't mean people are aren't out to get me.
    Someone heard that before. Okay, so I'll created A link a recurring meeting link
    for Our class meetings.
  persid: DHH
- desc: Me.
  persid: ???
- desc: See video link on our Meetings page. Alright. Well, Let me go back to So from
    So I worked out a way to present the summary, but I didn't. fill in the details
    or summary so The idea is for the transcripts of the audio and the chat. I will
    Use my discretion to come up with topics here. That we discussed like welcome.
    If you click on the topic and you can hide the details. And then I'll put in Various
    points here and I'll add links as appropriate. So So for example, we talked. I'm
    going to add the link for the CS web page. Building instructions. That's one of
    the things we talked about Anyway, So that was last day and then So I didn't I'm
    still working things out here a little bit. But then the notes for two or five
    meeting to Now, take it to the video. Where's the thing they won't always be videos,
    but maybe a links to look through and so forth. Try various say Maybe preparation
    or something, instead of notes so it can be an unknown location. Let me just make
    sure that it's there on the website. On the public website this is on my laptop
    when it's local host Does anyone here use the static site website generator So
    I'm using jackal. Well that's nice. Sorry, not that nice. You haven't used it
    yet, but I see that the when you're on your camera view you say no or yes or something
    and it pops up on the over top of the video. So that's very Very handy. I'm impressed
    with the zoom for that feature. I can't get a whole list of people Anyway, Okay,
    so this is the web page on On the public CS Department web server side. There.
    Today, when I had the chance to look at that already. Okay. So look at this over
    the weekend and then we can Talk about it next day in more detail. So the idea
    is That information entropy Like the third law of thermodynamics, entropy In some
    ways it is in some way that's not to me. I find it interesting that you talk about
    the entropy and information as measuring surprise. So if you think of tossing
    a coin. If it always lands on heads. Not necessarily a coin. For one thing, They're
    also not very much surprise in it. So if the odds of Getting ahead and getting
    a tail or equal at 50% then there's as much As we can handle from From that one
    coin. And So that's So we have two outcomes from flipping a coin zeros and one
    or heads or tails, which you can think of the zeros and ones. Which leads us to
    the Idea of a binary digit or best And so I'm going to Impress you quote unquote
    with my drawing skills in a minute here. I thought I don't have a video of this
    And I don't have The props with me. So I'll dress and I'll draw it out from the
    beginning, from the ground up. So this is going to be about An application of
    of Of encoding to represent different Different quantities. So if we look at A
    single bit. How many guys. Can we encode with that. You're welcome to use your
    microphone. And if you want to just unmute yourself for a bit, you can press the
    spacebar, I think. That's failing that, I will get out of my chat window. There's
    a question. Yeah, so Much. So another way to say it is how much information you
    know so we have to do is zero and one. And that's why, computer scientists like
    to start counting with zero Or the first array indexes zero Right, because precinct
    of Representation of it. If we say, off and on. So those two values us Euro and
    one Okay, so how many if we get to bits. How many values, can we represent. Okay,
    and how about three bits. Know 16 is four bits. All right. And 32 is five minutes.
    Yeah, that's right. So it's, it's an experience. So two times two times two were
    two to 38 Oh, you're just you're anticipating my question. That's very good. I
    can see you. Laughing I can hear you. Laughing So, That's Kind of a nice way to
    Experience it so that's That's eight bit. No. Yes, eight this is 256 OK, I can
    count so eight and 910 Okay. All right. Okay, so this is this is a lot of fun
    and we can go on to So we get the idea. So is anyone heard the story about The
    fellow who Who did a fair for the king and for the reward. King said Nate name
    which you'd like. He said, I'd like one grain of rice to put on This first square
    the chessboard And then The next square and have it doubled and then doubled again.
    It's all. Okay, sure. But by the time the chessboard is full. That's quite a big
    number, isn't it. So, You know the bit a bit can only store two values and put
    them together. In store lots and Lots of values. So, Without getting too philosophical
    there. Let me Sorry, bear with me for a second. I tried to get this working in
    rehearsal. Time. Okay, let me Try another thing here. I really better be worth
    it if I'm gonna Okay, made some progress here. Okay, so This is a Binary guessing
    game. Maybe you've heard about it. So, Okay. Okay, so if there's a One bet we
    can set us in the zero position. And we can say no. Or yes, So vs revalue here.
    Okay, let me back up and give you the context. So our binary guessing game. That
    I have available. Which I should make the materials available online somewhere.
    So you can see this and all its glory. So in that in the setup that I use. Generally,
    I have four cards. And a card that represents the one position. The two position
    before position and the position. So let's say I just had one card instead of
    four. So one card. And so The idea is to show that I have ESP extrasensory perception.
    Perception, I say, Is your number on this card and you say yes or no. So if I'm
    going to have one card. And I'm going to guess your number. Two. The card is going
    to have the number one on it. So what other constraints. So, what, what's the
    range of numbers. You can guess you can pick, I can guess. I'm sorry, I should
    have I got thrown off by the technology here a little bit, but
  persid: DHH
- desc: In this case, our options if I'm understanding you correctly would be one
    or zero as our number so Either way to say yes or no. You're going to know what
    our number is
  persid: S02
- desc: Yeah. That's right. So if I say pick a number between zero or one, zero and
    one. Pick a number either zero or one. And I show you the card with the one on
    it and you say, Yes, that's my number. And if you say no, that's not my number.
    Then I take the card and put it to my head and say, After some theoretical part
    theatrical pause I say this as the psychic energy travels from you to me. And
    I say, If you answered yes to that question your numbers one and if you answered
    no, that your number 01 card. Okay, now if I have two cards. What I'm going to
    do is Different combination There's two cards we have twice as many values possible
    Sorry. I have to make a little correction here. Alright. No, no, and we have To
    but no one. So then we have To end if we ever yes and yes it's a two and a one
    is three. So this Is the classic. How many different kinds of people are there
    in the world. If you It's funnier if you see it written out if there are one,
    zero kinds of people in the world. Those who understand binary and those who don't.
    Because one zero yes no is is equivalent to decimal to Because you can only represent
    one up to one with one between you. The second bit To represent The value of two
    And then if we have yes and yes three Two cards. Okay. Why don't you tell me I'll
    get my chat window open here again. So what are the numbers that we're going to
    write on one of the cards. OK. So the reason Is a nice a nice number Nothing against
    it. The reason I would vote, I would not choose that one is because
  persid: DHH
- desc: It.
  persid: ???
- desc: If I'm if I'm asking the question, Is your number on this card. And it's it
    and we have a number that is a zero. So that would answer. No, no. And it gets
    confusing. So what I'm gonna say is We put the From one column one in three Two
    and three No, that's not right. So if this is the card. I'm showing one three
    your answer yes to this. And then I show you the next card, which is two, three
    answer yes to this and what is the number going to have to be You have to be a
    three because you said yes to one and yes to the other. So the way we figure that
    out is Two plus one equals three. And we can see that if we say yes to both cards,
    the only number that appears on both of them. Is the three This let's do a three
    cards and then that should Be enough torture with this thing. I don't mean to
    create torture. I don't want to create that idea. Okay, so I saved that one. So
    I'm going to erase A little bit of this. OK, so now for a third card. We're going
    to write in
  persid: DHH
- desc: Pencil
  persid: ???
- desc: Alright, so adding a know in this third position doesn't change any of the
    existing values. So we still have 0123 But now let's copy everything down. And
    then for this one are going to Change the intro for change. The no to. Yes. Okay,
    so without These next word numbers. So we can figure that out. In a few different
    ways. Yeah 4567 So what we're doing here really one way, if it's helpful to think
    about it is taking these values and heading for to them. So zero plus four is
    for One plus four is five. To two plus Three plus four, seven. Consciously Yeah,
    so We can just go by. Each call If we say each column is a card and we just record
    designers have yeses beside them. In the values where there's a yes. So, for Six.
    Seven. And then for the to The next card to 367 And then we have One, three, Maybe
    too far down in the screen. I don't know what's going on here. Okay, so these
    are the three cards and I say to you get guess an hour between zero and seven.
    So how does this. How does this work in practice. So you have cards with these
    three these three cards with These sets of numbers on them. So can you explain
    how how to run the trick. To prove to unsuspecting grade school children that
    you're having Extra Sensory perception. Anyone's welcome to turn the microphone
    on for them.
  persid: DHH
- desc: So in this case we can assume that someone got for, for example. So when we
    show the first card. We would ask, do you have a number on the first part. So
    they have the Fort Detrick, they would say yes. So for us, we would know that
    the number is either four or five, six or seven And then next card and then for
    the next one, they would say no, definitely because the four is not there. So
    we know that six and seven cannot be the option we eliminate those two Then we
    go to the next card and they would say no, what's not on there too. So we are
    limited to five and then we can do that. It's
  persid: S03
- desc: Okay, that that's That That's a very good explanation.
  persid: DHH
- desc: The question though. Does that work the same. If we use the positions of the
    zeros instead of the ones right Like the yes the nose, instead of the yes
  persid: S03
- desc: Yeah. That would Be an extra level of indirection for people to say, So then,
    then you'd have And the third card, it has 02402460145 And 0123 trying to get
    my head around. To doing the tables. And this is all kind of like, well, it is
    math on the board for me. Yeah, so that's right So we could do things. Change
    it up and put the put the Nose yes and yes no and make a little more interesting
    for set of cards. That brings me to a point that it's a good segue into A topic
    about encoding. Let me just first say about the way to think about this. So if
    we have the cards. These three cards set up. With a forum on the top and to the
    top and one of the top If we make note of what's the number on the top number
    on the card or a free Print out a make a note on the back with the number is the
    top number is So if we say yes, no, yes. And we have four plus one. So if we have
    a yes who started out in this way, we started our guests at zero. And for every
    yes to a card we add the value we add to the first value on the card. So this
    card is yes, and we add four to zero. So we have four to start with. And if we
    say no to this card. We don't add anything, and if we say no to this card. We
    don't add anything And so if they say yes to the four card. Then we Pass dramatically
    and say your numbers for You can work out the instructions, if you if you flip
    it between The show the zeros to the Card be the 0246 And so far. Anyway, I'm
    getting I'm getting Work. Anyway, Alright. So that makes sense. First of all,
    so the idea is that we can have We have Three best we can store. And then the
    idea is necessary that we have to Don't have to store. We could say it's durable.
    We can also say it's 28 So we're going to store different values. So we can use
    this technique. We only need to store. Restore the index values here. We go. We
    only need three best to do that. We can storm. We can have a reference larger
    values. And that's what's done in images. For example, and we'll talk about it
    later. So if you have a We have 256 Spots to different guys you can represent
    So we can have them represent grayscale value. We can represent raise your turn
    black and white. Is a Fraction on that continuum, or we can use those value. Where
    we can have We can have each value reference look up into a table of full color.
    So, When when space is more of a premium. We could do this trick by storing on
    the eight bits. For the pixel dies. But then, having us. 236 index nice looking
    like of into a table that would We would have a palette of 20 256 colors. So we
    could have a Rich colored image. That have very little storage without the need
    to have Store each row is 24 bits. What time is it 10 minutes left. Okay. So we
    need more than three best represent Characters in the English language. Right.
    So we could we would need at least Values. So we could encode the characters in
    the text. So that would let us do the capital letters, plus a little bit of punctuation
    maybe Which which is a sci, which stands for American Standard Code for Information
    Interchange Someone pointed out that it's really know the American national Standard
    well anyway. We don't really talk about ASCII too much anymore directly. We talk
    about UT F8.
  persid: DHH
- desc: pretext.
  persid: ???
- desc: Okay. Which is skipping ahead a little bit So we're going to talk about ASCII
    and Unicode ETFs eight is a way to represent Unicode In a compact way. Store ASCII
    We don't even use 888 that would give us 236 more Me because another hundred and
    20 character positions. Because asked good for North American English. Not even
    Now even all the variations of English. With the different symbols and so an accent.
    So we'll talk about that in more detail what happens If we try and get more characters
    out of ASCII by using the eight bit And then That may be a good start, but it
    doesn't really get us very much for that and we As far as we need to go so Unicode
    is based on a form that form bite. So eight bits, the bite. So one bite for asking
    or it to a portion of a bite for ASCII And the Unicode is for by So that gives
    us a lot more potential But we don't have anyway. So there's some complications
    involved, and we'll talk about them in the next Next week, So if you can have
    a look at that video I posted And I'll post some other videos as well before Tuesday.
    Okay, and it will get your courses. Set up so So we'll start in earnest, with
    the attendance and then engage with us meetings. Tuesday. Okay. Okay. And I'll
    figure out how to better uses technology. See what What Zoom is telling me to
    do and what wasn't doing for me on my iPad. Anyway, Never a dull moment right
    so stay well. And we'll keep warm and Have a great weekend. And we'll talk to
    you on Tuesday. And I do have some office hours coming up. Well, I have an officer
    at 334 30 today. And Otherwise you can send me email or push to the forums and
    I'll get to them. So with that, I'll say goodbye. Thanks for today and we'll talk
    to you soon. Okay.
