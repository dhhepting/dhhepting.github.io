- desc: Good afternoon. password here. not sure which one. Sharing that screen or
    not. Now. mclaren was a big hit. So, if you like, we can. Take a look at a couple
    more the rest of that animated animating motion series. able to get my being an
    older person. To get my astro Seneca shot at the drive through clinic yesterday.
    i'm not feeling too much sure sure a little. little bit tired yeah thanks.

- desc: The national film Board of Canada presents.animated motion.By Norman mclaren
    and grant Monroe.Part three of a series of film homes in which mclaren comments
    on demonstrates and classifies aspects of motion which the animator employs in
    his everyday work.The fourth category.of movement is zero motion or.No motion
    at all animators call it a hold and for them zero motion is most important.You
    may ask how can no motion be important in animation it is as vital as a rest in
    music or a zero in arithmetic in itself it is nothing but in a context of what
    comes before and after it does become important.

- desc: In a sequence of single frame movement, the shortest possible hold occurs
    when there is no.
  persid: DHH
- desc: chain between two adjacent frames.At the start and finish of a movement holds
    play another role let's go back to our very first example of tempo the desk going
    from A to B in one frame.know if it's ever holds remove the whole.rather different
    result.The presence or absence of such hold it's more work with fast motions less
    marked with slow withhold.Without holds.Apart from being used as pauses at the
    start and end of movements holds maybe employed as a regular recurring part of
    the motion itself.Normal single frame, there are no holds.Double frame as one
    move.And one hold.triple frame one move and to hold.quadruple frame one move.and
    three.Six frame animation one move and five.The result first at a slow tempo.that's
    twice the temple.at four times the temple.Because the single and double framing
    are so widely used, let us make a side by side comparison.First, at a slow tempo.double
    the tempo.tempo again.Twitter increases tempo increases.Another common use of
    the whole world is accelerating to zero, and to decelerating from 05 fame hold.A
    36 frame whole.The whole has an impact, but put this 36 frame hold in another
    context decelerate to the hold and accelerate from the hold.The whole looks longer
    it has no impact or life of its own it merges into the overall movement Finally
    I use of zero motion in part, is the most common piece of animation syntax a hold
    it start and finish.In the middle section of constant motion.led into by an acceleration.And
    outdoor by deceleration.animators call the acceleration a taper in it may be longer.or
    shorter.The constant must linked.As also the deceleration or taper down, finally,
    the hold.This formula may have endless variations.Fifth and last basic category
    of movement is irregular motion.When it is impossible to predict the size of a
    move from the size of preceding moves we have irregular motion.A medium sized
    move.A tiny move.Huge move.A bit size move.Small move slightly bigger move in
    a zero.Slightly bigger move.Bigger still and the zero.Is smaller and three zeros.And
    a bigger move.The result.irregular motion has a character all its own often appearing
    as erratic capricious.purpose.

- desc: or even frightened. These 10 are the basic factors in animation first temple
    then constant accelerating decelerating zero and irregular motion by their skillful
    use the animator gives life, meaning character and spirit to no matter what subject.

- desc: Part three and.The national film Board of Canada presents animated motion.By
    Norman mclaren and grant Monroe.Part four of a series of films.In which mclaren
    comments on aspects of motion which the animator employees in his everyday work.So
    far, we've studied the main factor.actors in animation temple and the five basic
    categories or qualities of move.Constant accelerating decelerating zero and the
    regular we dealt with these factors singly but they often occur in combination
    to demonstrate this, let us turn this into a rod the rod will rotate it a test
    tempo and at the same time travels to the right at a slow tempo.Now the rod will
    rotate at a slow tempo by traveling at a moderate tempo.Now the rod will accelerate
    its rotation, while decelerating its travel.compound motion of this kind is very
    common.The combination of different motions by joining and pivoting of parts is
    of particular concern to the animator, for it is the basis of most animal and
    human locomotion on a static part another part will pivot.what's the moderate
    constant motion.Both parts will pivot.With a slow and fast constant motion boss
    will decelerate.Both as a unit accelerate.This is the anatomy of a salute.One
    part pivots constantly the other part, pivots with acceleration.The steeper the
    acceleration the crisper the solute.A gentle accelerating and decelerating action.A
    very steep acceleration down and an equally steep deceleration up.A gentle acceleration
    towards and a steep deceleration away from.here for calibrating is essential to
    convey the precise emotion of each action, how does the animator convey varying
    degrees of emotion, here is an action which is repeated was increasing amount
    of emotional stress the man is making a point in a discussion, he is calm and
    rational.The tempo of the downward and our productions was slow and the moves
    constant now he makes his point more firmly.The download moves have become a gentle
    acceleration the upward moves remain constant now he's quite emphatic.A steep
    acceleration down and the steep deceleration up.Now he is defiant.The up and down
    were even steeper and the overall temple more rapid.Almost all human actions are
    complex.For example.A man jumping off a stool.notice the delicate interplay of
    accelerations the celebrations and Constance.Before leaving motion, we must examine
    a phenomenon peculiar to frame by frame animation.notice how the edges shudder
    when the disk moves.This is called strobing.It happens because the edges of the
    disc are hard instead of blurred as with a disc shot normally at 24 frames, a
    second when and motion the blurred edges, reduce the strobing effect.The slower
    a hard edge image moves the less noticeable is the strobing.Until about this temple
    the strobing begins to disappear.When slower than this disrobing completely disappears.Is
    the strobing less with a black image on white or white image on black.When the
    contrast between image and background is diminished is there, less strobing.Is
    the strobing less when the color contrast or saturation is diminished.To sum up,
    high contrast and fast temples accentuate strobing low contrast lessons it and
    slow tempo is get rid of it all together.This completes our study of animated
    motion.The main factor is temple which overrides everything then come the five
    basic categories or qualities of movement constant accelerating decelerating zero
    and irregular apart from motion there remains one major element in animation this
    we will deal with in the next part of our series.Part four and.The national film
    Board of Canada presents.animated motion.By Norman mclaren and grant Monroe.Part
    Five of a series of films in which mclaren concludes this demonstration and his
    comments on animation.The first four parts of.Our series have dealt with motion
    by motion.tune we meant a shift of position and bass.touch motion is the animators
    main tool but candy animator animate without such motion, yes, by means of change
    change of like value tone texture form or color.Probably the most familiar type
    of change is the fade out where the total scene disappears.And the fade in.fade
    are made by the animator closing the light shutter of the camera.and opening it
    during shooting.More important for the animator than the fade out and the fade
    in is the mix or dissolve where one scene gradually changes to a second related
    seen.To make a make.The animators superimposes a fade out of the first scene upon
    a fade in and have the related scene, if the related seen differs only in part
    from the first scene, he gets a partial mix, it can be a mix out.or a mix in or
    the partial makes can be used for a change of color.A change of texture.A change
    a form.or a change of lighting.All change must have a temple and fall into one
    of the five categories.Its temple depends upon the amount of difference between
    the two scenes and more especially upon the length of the mix here is a range
    of mix lens a 144 frame mix out.A 96 frame mix out.4820 463.leading to a change
    in one frame.At 24 to the second.mixes chart one right after another, from what
    is called a chain of mixes a chain which may contain mixes of various durations
    permits the animator a prolonged flux of light and color.Change mixes have many
    applications for example.People to animate this texture a chain of mixes each.Six
    frames Long may be needed.Or it makes each four frames long.or a chain.Of one
    fame change.is normal single frame animation.By way of contrast, the chain of
    mixes each 128 frames long is needed to animate this landscape.The quickest form
    of change is in one frame or in 120 fourth of a second.there's.To pop on and the
    POP off.The pop from one culture to another.There can be a momentary disappearance
    by popping eight frames is off.64218 frames on.6421 peak popping off and on may
    not be interesting it slowed him.To such as eight.Faster tempo such as to.It produces
    the curious effect.Many types of flicker possible.The shading on the spheres and
    background.owned and the motion of the horizon line or optical illusions.This
    completes our study of the two main elements in animation motion and change both
    are modulated by temple and express themselves by means of the five basic categories
    and knowledge and intuitive use of these fundamentals, will give the animator
    mastery over his medium.End of Part Five and end of the series on animated motion.
