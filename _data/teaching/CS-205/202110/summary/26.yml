- desc: Hello everyone.
  persid: DHH
- desc: today.
  persid: ???
- desc: pendants here. how's everyone doing today. So. The. Last semester was. Two
    hours. and your courses and we had 15 questions. didn't do proctor track or anything
    like that. That our exam isn't for two weeks from today and it's an until two
    weeks from today. So i'm. i'm open to. accepting your ideas for questions. put
    on the exam. Between now and let's see next. In a week's time. So the things that.
    A fair assessment of all we did this semester. i'm thinking, yes to. No proctor
    track. So what I will do. To help you reviewing things is to go through make sure
    that all the summaries the transcripts. of me talking and you chatting. or on
    the website. And then. So what kinds of. So i'm going to put the shared screen
    videos up. I have to do those one by one. So i'll get going on, that today, even,
    I think. So do you have any thoughts about good questions to do for P five js.
    Should we have five GS questions. here's some code, what does it do. I didn't
    know the iPhone had a. anyway. Sorry. iPhone is not a really indicative name of
    who's attached to it. Well, I didn't realize that Elon musk came from, is it.
    Years ago, my son and I had or he had this idea about. Having an APP to generate
    starbucks names, so he was the names you get put on cups. seems to me like a similar.
    approach. He is going to fit into at.
  persid: DHH
- desc: This.
  persid: ???
- desc: season, easy to have Elon musk color it's just a matter of typing in a few
    letters into the. zoom account. So, because you're not using proctor track it's
    hard for me to say that it won't be an open book exam. But the idea is, if you
    have. time you have. It will be counterproductive to. spend a lot of time coordinating.
    and looking up answers. make sense. As is already. So yes, I will concur with
    with the 4% consensus, yes. So I would say in terms of suggesting questions, if
    you look at the practice exam. In terms of what's available what's demonstrated
    there and the practice exam. You might have some ideas about. formats for the
    question that. they're supported by your courses. We can. hear assessment of learning
    there during the Semester and. Something that can be implemented expressed well
    in terms of moodle your courses. That makes sense. kinds of questions i've asked
    in the past in terms of the practice final. The. previous ones before the for
    the pandemic. So 2019. Winter might be. The best example of those in terms of
    what kinds of questions that might ask it was the most recent one. refresh the
    screen see. here's a block of text there. What is the appropriate adjective. You
    are multimedia. couple alternatives, both you new media and multimedia or neither
    unit median or multimedia. Please explain. So. I recall through the mess of time
    talking about this early on in the Semester. So Nicholas Negroponte, who is the
    founder, I believe, of the MIT media lab. So you new media because it's all zeros
    and ones. So therefore it's unit media. Instead of multimedia. But even though
    we have Union media. In terms of representation of all everything in binary. strings
    of zeros and ones. See interpretation that's important that gives us the. ability
    to. convey and encode. images and text and sounds and animations. So that ring
    any bells. Now. You can. So i'm not gonna say which one I think is. I would say
    it's either it's one of the two it's not neither not. it's not uni media not.
    know our multimedia, I would say. I guess I would lean towards both but not to
    say that. saying you know media or multimedia would be. yeah. Which color model
    is most intuitive. Why do you like rgb so much. Because it makes sense okay good
    answer. colors is easy. Is it easy to change colors and say well i'd like a little
    less saturated. And like red but not fully saturated. yeah so red green and blue
    are additive. So it should be as additive so that means you start with black and
    we add color to it. So cmi K. Is what in relation to rgb. And why do we have.
    yeah that's right. The CMO is attractive so that's what these are printing because
    we. Put the ink on the paper and then its tracks from white light. And case for
    black. So there's a couple. Okay. So let's check is going on about magenta and
    his printer commercials.

- desc: good afternoon!
  persid: S03
- desc: Good afternoon Prof
  persid: S04

  persid: S05
- desc: Hello!
  persid: S06
- desc: Student password
  persid: DHH
- desc: Good
  persid: S07
- desc: Good1
  persid: S02
- desc: '!*'
  persid: S02
- desc: I think I would need to review what we covered in this course before I can
    generate any good question ideas :)
  persid: S03
- desc: It will be the same format of 2 hours on urcourses, no proctor track?
  persid: S08
- desc: hmm
  persid: S02
- desc: Create a reset sketch function I. P5.js
  persid: S09
- desc: code with what it does would be good
  persid: S03
- desc: It can be difficult to get things to work in P5.JS. If its 3D related
  persid: S02
- desc: also to understand^
  persid: S02
- desc: I would like to do some more of the lab work as well, honestly
  persid: S05
- desc: "So don\u2019t make it 3d"
  persid: S09
- desc: Will this be an open or closed book exam?
  persid: S10
- desc: one time there was Elon Musk here
  persid: S05
- desc: "I\u2019m logging into my computer"
  persid: S09
- desc: or was it another class, I forgot sry
  persid: S05
- desc: nice
  persid: S05
- desc: yea
  persid: S02
- desc: So is that to say that it is technically open book but you wont have time
    to read?
  persid: S10
- desc: yup
  persid: S04
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: So our final will be very similar to posted practice finals?
  persid: S12
- desc: where can we find the practice final?
  persid: S13
- desc: http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~hepting/assets/teaching/pdf/CS-205-201910_exam-2-final.pdf
  persid: DHH
- desc: thank you
  persid: S13
- desc: So what would be? BOTH?
  persid: S12
- desc: it*
  persid: S12
- desc: "Unimedia in the sense of representation but multimedia in the sense of interpretation\u2026\
    .. is that the line of thought?"
  persid: S12
- desc: provided you could make a solid argument
  persid: S11
- desc: RGB
  persid: S11
- desc: RGB
  persid: S12
- desc: RGB
  persid: S04
- desc: because it makes sense
  persid: S11
- desc: It is commonly used
  persid: S08
- desc: intuitive
  persid: S12
- desc: At least that is what I have found
  persid: S08
- desc: "I hadn\u2019t used HSB until this class"
  persid: S08
- desc: Red Green and Blue values have additive coloring properties
  persid: S05
- desc: because the colour numbers are easy to change
  persid: S11
- desc: trick question, its a bank?
  persid: S05
- desc: CMYK is subtractive, and K is black.
  persid: S06
- desc: HAHA
  persid: S04
- desc: cyan magenta and yellow and black
  persid: S11
- desc: god damn expensive magenta
  persid: S05
- desc: lol
  persid: S11
- desc: sorry
  persid: S05
- desc: YEAH BRO@SHAREEF
  persid: S04
- desc: its worth more than blood and gold at times, with its market price
  persid: S05
- desc: hue saturation and brightness
  persid: S11
- desc: I just look these ones up and copy and paste the code over
  persid: S11
- desc: we should know the relationship
  persid: S11
- desc: They help to reduce aliasing.
  persid: S06
- desc: If you sample/quantize at a high amount.
  persid: S06
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S12
- desc: in p5? youll need an array of pixels?
  persid: S11
- desc: youll need to decided if you are using amplitude or fft
  persid: S11
- desc: to match the pixels to the sound
  persid: S11
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: but we didn't use that in our program, so are we allowing user to upload sound
    and an image?
  persid: S11
- desc: or just an image?
  persid: S11
- desc: that's actually a great question
  persid: S11
- desc: ill code I in p5.js all day long
  persid: S11
- desc: I think talk about p5.js would be good for the exam
  persid: S13
- desc: Yep
  persid: S02
- desc: YUP
  persid: S04
- desc: 'yes'
  persid: S11
- desc: sorry if you don't like p5.js
  persid: S11
- desc: I think giving 30% of the final to labs should be reasonable
  persid: S14
- desc: YUP
  persid: S04
- desc: lol no
  persid: S11
- desc: haha
  persid: S04
- desc: oh isee what you are saying
  persid: S11
- desc: haha
  persid: S02
- desc: that may not be a bad idea
  persid: S11
- desc: I really liked the 2o5 lab, I learned a lot there for creativity
  persid: S05
- desc: '205'
  persid: S05
- desc: 30% sees high though
  persid: S11
- desc: ^ Adobe licenses were expensive. But great lab
  persid: S02
- desc: 30% seems REALLY high. Seeing as lab already some allocation towards your
    grade
  persid: S12
- desc: Nova is the best, she made my day
  persid: S11
- desc: yeah thats true
  persid: S14
- desc: I would like a question about the lab on the final though
  persid: S11
- desc: I heard she won't be doing it anymore :(
  persid: S05
- desc: best lab instructor
  persid: S04
- desc: At least im glad I got to work with her, one last time.
  persid: S05
- desc: same here
  persid: S04
- desc: regina public library has a digital media studio that the u of r students
    are free to use and they have adobe creative cloud
  persid: S11
- desc: it includes a whisper room for recording
  persid: S11
- desc: just not during a pandemic
  persid: S11
- desc: and a green screen
  persid: S11
- desc: I think I missed the answer earlier, is the exam open or closed book?
  persid: S06
- desc: im glad I got to take another class with you
  persid: S11
- desc: Yea very interesting. A more creative and visual side of CS.
  persid: S02
- desc: thanks, I did. I learned a lot with p5.js
  persid: S05
- desc: the class was interesting, added some background knowledge to things we code
    / see on the regular basis in terms of display and soud
  persid: S03
- desc: really enjoyed CS 205
  persid: S04
- desc: When can we expect the class transcripts to be done
  persid: S13
- desc: Sounds good.
  persid: S02
- desc: sounds good
  persid: S11
- desc: Sounds like a plan
  persid: S12
- desc: "I have work today so I won\u2019t be able to attend office hours so can I\
    \ email you instead?"
  persid: S14
- desc: okay
  persid: S11
- desc: This class has been a lot of fun, thank you!
