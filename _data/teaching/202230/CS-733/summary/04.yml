- desc: So I'm not sure how well this application is working in being a transcription
    of our discussion. But we'll keep working at it same the same
  persid: ''
- desc: so I
  persid: ''
- desc: have to download our full PDF still for the syllabus which I will get done
    today. Save money producers so that's a little different than 730 some more weight
    and assignments, less weight on the final exam and sweeten the midterm so half
    during this semester half on exams
  persid: ''
- desc: okay, you can see me all right so
  persid: ''
- desc: you so these are the PowerPoint slides that we were looking at the other day
    okay so last day we talked about
  persid: ''
- desc: so back here okay so
  persid: ''
- desc: we talked last day about See if we start with the mathematical So, we start
    with a description of seeing formulas for a sphere for example that represents
    our eight scoop of ice cream and ice cream cone.
  persid: ''
- desc: So, if we start with that description then if we make it 512 By 512 Or are
    we prepared for it 505k by 5k or whatever resolution we'd like to produce then
    we can get a high quality disk discrete raster image for So, if we start with
    a discrete representation if we start with something which has which is rendered
    at 128 by 120 pixels, we can still make that any size we want. But what's the
    difficulty Sorry
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's
  persid: ''
- desc: think of a diagonal line. So we can specify the endpoints, the coordinates
    00. And one one but if we convert it to one so, when we want to put onto the screen
    we need to decide which which pixels or what every pixel in display what value
    should should they be set to try that again. For every so we're, we're deciding
    what value each sample for each pixel on the screen is will be set to to represent
    this line
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we
  persid: ''
- desc: convert it to. generally have an image is 10 by 10 but I can match draw that
    on the board you can imagine using bigger images.
  persid: ''
- desc: So far so good
  persid: ''
- desc: well I've made two small claims so just added a little bit here so for drawing
    that line Imagine seeing how much by the economic get on this
  persid: ''
- desc: Sophie
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's think about some other lines here as well. Think about the one that
    goes along the x axis
  persid: ''
- desc: and then maybe one that goes this way.
  persid: ''
- desc: So what do you notice about these different lines are these approximations
    of different lines okay so let's imagine that I've drawn squares here. I know
    that might be a bit of a stretch to join
  persid: ''
- desc: squared by using that plan this while you're talking about something else,
    no I meant
  persid: ''
- desc: imagine that each of these
  persid: ''
- desc: is a square so the width
  persid: ''
- desc: of this line is the height of the square but the diagonal line is thinner
    because it's only squares early touching. So
  persid: ''
- desc: at this point, let's say are there were the square or the samples or the pixels
    are touching the width of the line is just the point but the then again here it's
    square root. So this is a unit square then the width here is the square root of
    to so it's 1.41 something so if we zoomed in further see the diagonal line looks
    like this. A little bit.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we think of
  persid: ''
- desc: a line being a unit unit with.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we see
  persid: ''
- desc: we have we're not getting any. So the line is crossing these. These pixels
    that don't have aren't set at all. So it'd be nice to reflect at some point line
    is crossing them to some degree. So we're
  persid: ''
- desc: not sampling or not taking enough samples to be able to reconstruct this line
    accurately. So does anyone heard the term aliasing? Before? No? Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: that's good to know. So we have the function of anti aliasing.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anti aliasing is a way to address this sampling issue.
  persid: ''
- desc: was an honor so I expected it wouldn't last very long. So they may address
    sampling issues. But it's also a question of quantization because we can't just
    store for storing if we're only storing one bit per pixel whether it's on or off.
    You get instead of getting a more nuanced line and we would add.
  persid: ''
- desc: That doesn't look much better. It just is thicker. So we need to be able to
    represent the fact that this is almost 100% And this is maybe closer to 40% or
    something like that. So if we can represent
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have two beds
  persid: ''
- desc: gonna write it off
  persid: ''
- desc: so we might be able to represent four values. So it can pixel can be off,
    it can be on for 1/3 and it could be on for two thirds and then on 100%. some
    extent so if we have four bits then we can represent increments of less than 10%.
    So we can so it'd be about 6% Six, six is 97 would be 105. So so each each end
    we can represent increments of about six six and a half percent. With four beds.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay so
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that makes sense? So if we start with a discrete image so if we start
    with a formula that we're converting to discrete, then whatever range x is, so
    if it's 2048 by 2048 that means that we're going to get and using anti aliasing
    we can get very close and get a smooth looking line. Whatever resolution see
  persid: ''
- desc: is my 250.
  persid: ''
- desc: So you can see these are all vector formats, getting into what's done for
    anti aliasing. The blurring between these two colors on the header
  persid: ''
- desc: I was I thought there was something on their
  persid: ''
- desc: stream but anyway, that gives you a sense of what the effect is when we have
    a discrete resolution object that is certain so this they can see this effect
    because the image is generated more resolution than we have displayed here. So
    we don't have enough data so we're resampling the image to it as we zoom in and
    there's not enough data to resolve the slide into a smooth line.
  persid: ''
- desc: Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: So okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: in our forming, creating images, so we can think of a camera being in a scene
    Do you like me writing on the blackboard as well or should I just stick with a
    whiteboard
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, So what can we think? Of
  persid: ''
- desc: this example of a camera and
  persid: ''
- desc: what it's called so for some
  persid: ''
- desc: buildings from ancient Greece so what are the elements we have? Let's maybe
    see that we're exposing the film. So we're capturing some pieces of the world
    which is might be several 100 meters.
  persid: ''
- desc: So how much what are we capturing on the film? So, field of use made determined
    by the lenses that are brought the camera
  persid: ''
- desc: CMRA this lens so as a computer we might have a projection, transformation,
    viewing transformation that would either make it a perspective or orthographic
    but there's a number to choose from. Successful well it's not always film that
    we're using now. It could be digital cameras they have we don't have a continuous
    image then transform it into a discrete one we recapture pixels so quick sampling
    is done in the camera so under taking a picture if it's
  persid: ''
- desc: if it's noonday sun, who would expose
  persid: ''
- desc: the detectors, the film where are our electronics to a very short amount we
    would have a very quick shutter exposure opening to capture the light onto the
    detector because if we left it open then it would become overexposed.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if it was
  persid: ''
- desc: a new moon at night, then we'd keep the exposure longer. Because it was delayed.
  persid: ''
- desc: See what else can we observe? About. Like
  persid: ''
- desc: to be natural or artificial for taking a picture of her taking a picture outside.
    You might like to catch the light at a certain time of day but in an effort to
    get a computer models and we don't have natural light everything is artificial
  persid: ''
- desc: so in
  persid: ''
- desc: in the real world as we're looking at different objects here we can see that
    the whiteboard is shiny and reflects the light from the computer we need to think
    of describing the properties of surfaces so that when light when we model lay
    Ray hitting it that be desired interactions or effect. So if we have a model of
    the room, you can see this whiteboard might be colored white walls are the color
    beige and you're gonna go blue
  persid: ''
- desc: all that blue
  persid: ''
- desc: what's a better name for it so yeah
  persid: ''
- desc: I don't think that's I
  persid: ''
- desc: don't know. What's that dark blue. Okay
  persid: ''
- desc: I was wondering if someone's gonna say turquoise or aquamarine or anyway,
    I'm not very good at colors. Some colors anyway can describe the services as having
    a certain color property
  persid: ''
- desc: and an approximation of the front of the room would be dark blue and white,
    the white, dark blue the wall wait for the whiteboard
  persid: ''
- desc: green for the Blackboard and this is white as well for the projector screen
  persid: ''
- desc: so we in our description of the of the room in the mind our model of the room.
    Then we can we can create a model that looks like the room. Dimensions of let's
    see eight feet, probably for the ceiling to two meters in something for the ceiling.
    For those who don't speak Imperial. Many people are fluent in Imperial measurements
    about metric about some other one nothing I ask will cause you to raise your hand
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so there
  persid: ''
- desc: so you can say so he says note the independence of the objects the viewer
    and the light sources so the world in our view of this, of this room, ever taking
    a photograph we don't have to worry about calculating the interaction between
    the lights from the projector and the lights from the room that are in the room
    and bouncing as they bounce off the shiny white board. And so forth. We can just
    put objects in an environment with whatever lighting we want to put there. And
    then we can just capture that with the camera. I mean there are more and more
    options so even on your iPhones or Androids the cameras are becoming quite, quite
    advanced so you can do a lot of different effects with them. So we can do more
    complicated models of cameras.
  persid: ''
- desc: The same thing, though with
  persid: ''
- desc: the computer models we have to account for. We have to look for the interaction
    with light sources and surfaces. So if you think of camera can do ray tracing
    is an approach to creating a model so instead of instead of collecting late in
    the scene, it's the film where the detectors were we go from the other way we
    go through each pixel on what can what can be seen associated with with a sample
  persid: ''
- desc: that's going to fall off
  persid: ''
- desc: The one that was rather than run out
  persid: ''
- desc: The Lake started therapy legs on in the scene. So things that are going to
    show up in
  persid: ''
- desc: ultimately, each point display is things that have some an interact with the
    weights leg so source in some way. We'll discuss the details of modeling that
    properties trying to take a picture of a room that has no lights off, might get
    a very faint image if there's some ambient light that comes in, but it might just
    be we get a black image so we need to have some lights in there. Now we're out
    of time. So lates foreshadows innocence so we can measure the different wavelengths
    of light. Our human visual system
  persid: ''
- desc: responds well to read those responses and so that's why we have
  persid: ''
- desc: model colors that deals with red and the images
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so for Thursday let's continue to think about
  persid: ''
- desc: that parallels between waiting interested in the camera and computer software
    and then we'll look at
  persid: ''
- desc: so called again for next, sorry. So if you have access to the next
  persid: ''
- desc: chapter today as well okay. Thank you very much. from them.
  persid: ''
