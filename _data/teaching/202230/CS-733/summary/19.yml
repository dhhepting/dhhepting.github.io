- desc: It was recording but it wasn't That's CMRA to do one to six I'm here you can
    talk to me
  persid: ''
- desc: this chapter is included.
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. Okay a few smiles but chapters one through six that's so we we've got
    up to with the viewing transformations and light washes lighting and materials.
    Listening so am I talk about what is some what fragments of code are doing what
    is
  persid: ''
- desc: what is going on in this piece of code? Would you like some multiple choice
    questions you are here this very quiet yeah okay. So, do you have ideas about
    what you'd like to see from multiple choice questions Okay. The spirit of KTLA?
    And guess what TLA is maybe that's a good bonus question. What do you think JTP
    is like some previous shot would like to involve me conversation trying to figure
    out what I wrote out three letter abbreviations
  persid: ''
- desc: You. So we talked about
  persid: ''
- desc: two decisions we can make what's the decision about each sample So, we've
    been talking about 24 bit color. So, we're storing 24 beds. We're just storing
    each sample in terms of 24 beds and RGB might be 32 bits if we start the alpha
    component
  persid: ''
- desc: so for doing eight bits per channel how many different values can we start
    in the red green and blue? Zero now answer
  persid: ''
- desc: I think I'll do 55 for red, or blue and for green right?
  persid: ''
- desc: Those 256 Because we start with 00. So together we get 16 point 7 million
    color possibilities. So if we use if we only have eight beds So we can have index
    images so it was six values each correspond to a full four bit RGB color in the
    old days, like in the 90s you frequently have index images and then it would be
    a case of
  persid: ''
- desc: maybe you don't have the right palette loaded. So you could get strange looking
    images because if you're on a system that has standard palette different from
    the one that you created with which you created the image So for creating a computer
    generated image what's a model we can think of yeah painting that's not the one
    I was thinking. So to create a painting requires some skill on the person of the
    person creating the image what are some ways that are maybe have a lower threshold
  persid: ''
- desc: sketches
  persid: ''
- desc: are. Pants not
  persid: ''
- desc: raw and not run picking?
  persid: ''
- desc: Does your phone have any capability for creating pictures man? So we can create
    the model and we can describe the scene let's just say we have a scene so we point
    our camera at the scene and then we make some decisions we want to have a perspective
    projection we have this is a little bit like choosing the lens so remember these
    are all the objects in the scene are are virtual so we don't have to think about
    if we want to look from a straight we don't
  persid: ''
- desc: want to look from a particular position. We don't have to worry about how
    to get to that position. We can specify the position of the camera in world coordinates
    but ultimately, we're getting into this is again is supposed to be a cube so the
    book combination of the modelview matrix and the projection matrix we specify
    these things when we apply it. Then we end up
  persid: ''
- desc: things being displayed in the picture or are inside the clipping coordinates
  persid: ''
- desc: What do you think?
  persid: ''
- desc: Any questions or concerns should we do the three letter acronym any other
    questions for the people who are a little stumped the people who aren't here when
    you talk to them, you can describe some wild things
  persid: ''
- desc: no don't do that.
  persid: ''
- desc: So midterms are worth 10 marks towards the final Yeah,
  persid: ''
- desc: how many questions will be there?
  persid: ''
- desc: I did eight on a 15 minute midterm. So maybe 12 or 75 minutes if you have
    suggestions I will welcome them until the 14th.
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, well everyone feeling good
  persid: ''
- desc: about the break anyway okay. Thank you for today.
