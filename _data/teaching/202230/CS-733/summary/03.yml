- desc: 'okay gonna get a

    meeting maybe one will have the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'base JC Pena. Unfortunately

    you''re done was a specialist'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'machine switchback PC morning

    I''m going to show you up set up'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay US okay so as far as

    storage business'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'saw some of the thing that I

    thought I put up here isn''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'working morning going on got it

    right Hello departments Welcome'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to our Tuesday that was it only

    I''m giving up on my computer I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'apologize know I have so many I

    also crisis Shouldn''t this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be Guys evening so what did we

    talk about last day history'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'chapter one Morning not 100%

    sure I''ve drawn the right number'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of blanks there. So, we talked

    about a couple of different ways'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to represent images that we came

    across a term that starts with D'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and contrasts that with a term

    that starts with C you can ask'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for letters if you don''t know

    right away you don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: guess without asking for letters
  persid: ''
- desc: this is second and X
  persid: ''
- desc: 'no no a deal no it is easy to

    hear our head was there someone'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say see your screen and I missed

    Mr. Blank so let''s see the other'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one see and see how well they go

    with this. One so what are some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples of discrete

    representations of graphics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what are some continuous

    examples'
  persid: ''
- desc: spider is pretty continuous. So,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a bar graph can be either

    discrete or continuous. So the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'idea of a bar graph isn''t one or

    the other but so if we describe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the shape of the bars if we

    store the bar graph, in terms of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'different bars and the

    rectangles and the colors and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'all the elements if we store

    them in terms of the description'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of the shapes then it lends

    itself to continue. We still can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'capture the continuous idea we

    haven''t discretize. So a format'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that lets us keep a continuous

    representation of an image is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scalable vector graphics. So

    generally we might describe this'
  persid: ''
- desc: as a vector format.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So if we think about that pen

    plotter model that we talked'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about last week so we are not we

    have a model of drying the bar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'graph on a piece of paper with a

    pen and we''re converting or'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re creating that image in a

    continuous form'
  persid: ''
- desc: so what's
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if we''re not drawing on paper,

    but we''re drawing on a laptop'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen when could that

    representation of the bar graph'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be made into a discrete form to

    to allow it to be displayed on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the street. So for creating a

    representation at a certain'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'resolution and we''re taking the

    continuous description of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image and deciding the values

    should be associated with each'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'sample and then. So that makes

    sense. Let''s think about let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do a bar graph here. I think

    there''s anyone heard the idea of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I scream you scream we all

    scream for ice cream. Yes, yeah.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. Let''s do a yes and a no.

    No. Who screams for ice cream.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like it''s like a kick like

    Margot. Well, that''s for anybody'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you don''t have to audibly scream

    for ice cream. But so who likes'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'ice cream? Who would scream for

    it? Okay so far and we have for'
  persid: ''
- desc: '1177 don''t like ice cream. So

    any further to the map. So I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describe constraints describe

    these as lines and time texture'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make it okay so I can

    describe all these pieces of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image and I don''t have to worry

    about what''s visible or or how'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'on sampling and when I make a

    discrete representation of it.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So there's a
  persid: ''
- desc: 'is named after Nyquist but

    census Okay. So, think of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about in sound we want

    to sample the twice the highest'
  persid: ''
- desc: frequency so
  persid: ''
- desc: and sound
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we sound blood 44 kilohertz

    because people can hear up to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'about 2020 kilohertz. So we want

    to sample if we sampled 44 Then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can reconstruct frequencies

    that are up to 22 kilohertz So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so how does this translate

    images so you want to sample at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'half the size of the smallest

    object we want to capture'
  persid: ''
- desc: so if you so if I said.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Nash should have some different

    colored chalk or use the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'whiteboard but we''ll go with it

    so let''s say this is a part of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how I''m sampling. So if I sample

    at that point, so the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'intersection of grid lines you

    can see that I''m not getting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there. I''m not getting this

    detailed pattern so I have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make sure that well if we save

    they''re all the same size take'
  persid: ''
- desc: that leap of faith with me.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if we sample
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with the resolution that won''t

    read any detail pass through the'
  persid: ''
- desc: grid
  persid: ''
- desc: so it makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is about scan

    conversion. So we we create. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'let''s think about it as if we

    have a certain resolution of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: display. Then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we may or may not be able to

    capture all the fine detail.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Fact your drive in from the

    ideal representation I want to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'see The. I am moderately

    surprised that anyway, so here''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my favorite con from my website.

    And this is defined as a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scalable vector graphics image.

    So this is description the shape'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then to get onto
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the screen it''s gone through

    your process of discretization I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'can zoom in still looks good now

    I see if I can fix that. top'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'part. How do I get a new source

    here? So what I''ve done is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'described describe the shape by

    creating the unit circle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then inscribing have to gone

    seven sided regular polygon'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inside the unit desk and then

    I''ve built the shape inside so I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have a description that is

    Seamus inscribed with some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates. But when it''s

    discretized we can take those'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates and map them onto

    the screen. So we don''t have to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'lose the precision of the

    underlying description'
  persid: ''
- desc: when we
  persid: ''
- desc: 'create the discrete

    representation and projected on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the screen so the advantage is

    the we can rescale this easily'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and still get a very smooth

    looking image. This advantage is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that there''s extra time to

    process at from the description'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to the scan converted image that

    we see here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So that makes sense.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay. So this is the first

    sample that we looked at last'
  persid: ''
- desc: day
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I will have an aversion on my

    website today, I guess I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk to my laptop and figure out

    what''s wrong with and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'accomplish. Anyway, so we''re

    writing in HTML five here. So we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said that applications that are

    using WebGL have HTML file and a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'JavaScript file. So with WebGL

    we need to have to shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Vertex Shader which deals with

    the position and the fragment'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shader that deals with the color

    so these are defined in HTML as'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a script tags and then we have

    the JavaScript that has a common'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'function there to load the

    shaders, initialize the shaders,'
  persid: ''
- desc: and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the triangle.js that deals with

    drawing the triangle so what'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re describing here is Canvas

    so this is part of the screen.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'region of the screen. So we''re

    saying make it 512 by 512. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this is HTML, and we''re giving

    it an ID so that using the DOM'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Document Object Model in Jade

    JavaScript, we can get the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'element by ID and then use it in

    our JavaScript'
  persid: ''
- desc: so let me
  persid: ''
- desc: 'know when other thing here so

    this directive version 300. Yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this is the Shader Language.

    So it''s saying use 300 e 3.0.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Point Oh, version of the other

    language to compile.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So we'll talk about that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for just just a directive. If

    there aren''t, this isn''t a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directive here. Included here

    that will end up going to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version. One 1.0 point oh okay.

    So this image shaders part is'
  persid: ''
- desc: using the DOM
  persid: ''
- desc: to get the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex shader, and if it can''t

    locate an item, element with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that it then gives an a word to

    say that can''t vote the vertex'
  persid: ''
- desc: shader.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Otherwise, it takes the code

    that was written in in this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'element and compiles it so

    there''s very straightforward.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vertex and fragment shaders are

    very straightforward. They''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just returning positions and

    colors.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well, a single a single color.

    So the script will return a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'program that has a vertex shader

    and fragment shader. So use'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scripts use direct as a

    JavaScript directive. So we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a variable GL and variable

    points. So take this is es five'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the official name for JavaScript

    is ECMO script. That''s why it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'called Yes. Anyone know what

    ECMO stands for? I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'originally it was anyway the

    European computer Manufacturers'
  persid: ''
- desc: Association. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'window onload so that the script

    gets executed after the window'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'has been loaded. So being an net

    function, we find the canvas and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we get a context for rendering

    context associated with the'
  persid: ''
- desc: canvas.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re looking for WebGL

    version two. And if we can''t get'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that printed below display an

    alert WebGL 2.0 isn''t available.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So then we have points for the

    triangle. So minus one minus'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'one. Okay so if we start with

    minus one minus one and then we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'go to 01 and then one minus one

    so, now we''re associating screen'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'coordinates with these the

    viewport says it''s going to be'
  persid: ''
- desc: '005 12 512 and they''re going to

    clear the screen to be a white'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then we''re going to do that

    shader initialization and so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re getting the program back

    from the net shaders.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So, I just
  persid: ''
- desc: 'thinking about the details so,

    we''re setting up the mapping'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'between these coordinates and

    screen coordinates and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'buffer. In memory, we can create

    the discrete version of the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangle with. So setting things

    up a function called render once'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you set things up, we render and

    render says.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Draw points in the train so we

    are loading the buffer data'
  persid: ''
- desc: points and then we're drawing
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the points as triangles do so

    how about is her first activity?'
  persid: ''
- desc: You get a copy of this code
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and then you look at the

    difference between changing the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'size of the window and the

    canvas changing the number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'triangles to draw more than one

    triangle and change the colors'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so I want to apologize for the

    computer problems today. I think'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I''ve made some improvements to

    the website that I have and I'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'well then that''s not very

    evident in what I showed you'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'today. So I apologize for that.

    And we''re going to have a lot of'
  persid: ''
- desc: fun doing computer graphics
  persid: ''
- desc: not just fun,
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but interesting things with

    WebGL and graphics. So we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'talk about the plan in more

    detail on Tuesday and then we''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'get into some examples and get

    into some more substantive'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'issues okay. Hey, right. So seem

    okay can''t yet Okay, so we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'out of time for today. So I have

    the boy listen. You can make a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'comment, your response to the

    meeting today. You can do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Set up the attendance and

    anyway, any any other comments'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or questions before we wrap up

    today?'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah. No
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so we''ll talk about that in

    detail on Monday on Tuesday. Is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that okay? You''re welcome. You

    can hang on to those and put'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'them out for me. So I I know

    some some of your names but just'
  persid: ''
- desc: just to help
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, thank you again for today.

    Have a good day and have a good'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'weekend. Take care. I''ll see you

    and I have office hours in'
