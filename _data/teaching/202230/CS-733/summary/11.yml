Audio-Transcript:
- desc: Due to reasonable settings for assignments, or do you have somebody show me
    to or not? So first when somebody's second, like auditioning, like, show me more
    than when he was when he was 2021 because I purposely selected all file types
    so I'm curious about
  persid: ''
- desc: zip has been selected as
  persid: ''
- desc: well I think. Anyway I will check we'll get it resolved. Okay. So I noticed
    this trackball up application. It doesn't give any feedback. Like it doesn't tell
    you anything about how to control it so far. So good so
  persid: ''
- desc: now I've
  persid: ''
- desc: taken square we worked in a bit into the mouse has an example. So that's not
    a complete example, but it gives you a start. So
  persid: ''
- desc: if all goes well, I mean just if you want to help me with my web contents
    there is now
  persid: ''
- desc: a public will not see us so
  persid: ''
- desc: that'd be w w two.cs. Blah, blah blah is running as an old machine running
    old software. This is a new machine running updated software. So if you notice
    any issues with my website
  persid: ''
- desc: using this URL I would appreciate knowing about and I talked to another class
    yesterday about this. It seems like
  persid: ''
- desc: a combination of me adding use strict to my JavaScript and browsers being
    updated on campus. Things work now with this I would welcome your input about
    how to make this more useful this page.
  persid: ''
- desc: So anyway, I just wanted to point that out. I have to do a little bit better
    with this thank.
  persid: ''
- desc: You so here is a square and so instead of having 200 points or something I've
    got 10 points set up here you get different colors. 5.6789 10. And then it says
    no more points can be stored. So it's using an event listener and when it get
    after it that dialog box comes up. I remove the event listener okay so let me
    just show you the basic structure of HTML so I've got UTF eight, of course anyway,
    so the top that's the CSS from Bootstrap and the vertex shader, the fragment shader
    and the other scripts, so dnn, shaders and the matrix vector library and then
    the mouse Jas. And then in the body here, so you have a card you can do the markup
    a little
  persid: ''
- desc: you can do it.
  persid: ''
- desc: A little differently. I suppose you could say I think page one class card
    header will work instead of having a div this is just more pedantic. Just specifying
    all the details. Anyway. So then in the card body I have I do have 1/3 the screen
    to open up the mess of WordPress private or the most clicks were so forth. And
    then two thirds for for the campus so that CMRA oh and at the bottom there's CDN
    for the JavaScript. Okay,
  persid: ''
- desc: have a question. Okay. Should you have if you come across right handed in
    left hand and coordinates systems before
  persid: ''
- desc: so what's the issue
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we have a two dimensional system, x and y there's no confusion there.
    But when we add Zed do we add said this way? We said let's make sure we're talking
    about positives. So it said positive going into this away from us or is instead
    of positive coming out towards us coming out
  persid: ''
- desc: but depends on decision to make whether it's left handed or right handed.
    So I'll show you a couple this is the way that I've thought about it or I've been
    told about it. So if you want to do X times Y them directional positive Zed is
    the way that my thumb is pointing. So if I do x times y, x cross y, positive Zed
    is coming out of this screen out of coming towards me. So this is a right hand
    corner. If you choose Set positive in this way. This is a right handed coordinate
    system. Say another way. Thumb is X, Y is index finger. Zed said his middle finger
    so my poor cat. She she's a wonderful kitten cat and she's 14 I think now but
    she injured her tail. So the vet had to amputate the last link and then stitch
    it up and so it would heal and we'll keep keep bothering her. So she shaved the
    end of it. After the bandage comes off. And she's walking around the house with
    her tail and then there's this little piece that comes up it's I should really
    show you a picture I'll get a picture. I don't think I have it on my phone. Anyway
    okay, so if we're doing this the left x y. Zed is going into the away from us.
    So this is a little bit easier than doing so right had us upset is coming out
    towards us and left handed positives is going away from us okay, here's another
    another issues and see we defined coordinates for a triangle let's do two versions
    of the triangle
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: so one is clockwise so you can think of if we follow the clockwise if we follow
    the order of points clockwise
  persid: ''
- desc: the normal vector for that triangle is going to be pointing out
  persid: ''
- desc: and then do the same thing. Right and again so we're going to gather them
    up so the veck the marble is pointing away from us.
  persid: ''
- desc: So why is that important? That we think about the order of vertices in a triangle.
    In a primitive?
  persid: ''
- desc: So I'm talking about triangles. What's the advantage of using triangles? Over
    quadrilaterals or symbolic other polygons? So are those four points in the quadrilateral
    are they on on a plane?
  persid: ''
- desc: Well, they might be
  persid: ''
- desc: but they have to be. So question makes sense. So when we're modeling things,
    we'd like to have an unambiguous model.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we can
  persid: ''
- desc: we can conceptualize well, I'll show you the source code for a cube dot j
    s. So we can
  persid: ''
- desc: are you asking about the advantage of
  persid: ''
- desc: yes in modeling, why, why do we prefer triangles?
  persid: ''
- desc: I think they can make quite a number of shapes. If you put the straps
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so are they always quadrilaterals are they always on a plane?
  persid: ''
- desc: Not always. But triangles are. So we can define a plane with three points
    three non collinear points
  persid: ''
- desc: 40 or 30 day kind of thing.
  persid: ''
- desc: While 2d Wood is a special case of 3d in terms of
  persid: ''
- desc: so for thinking about 2d.
  persid: ''
- desc: One of them is facing facing us when the other one is facing away
  persid: ''
- desc: if we think about
  persid: ''
- desc: it the position of the normal vector for the surface so the normal vector
    is perpendicular to the plane so when we have a triangle we we can talk about
    its normal vector those ideas make sense so that the normal vector is perpendicular
  persid: ''
- desc: we can find sorry good picture because I do okay, so what are modeling things?
    In computer graphics where the there are points
  persid: ''
- desc: and scalars and vectors So, the advantage of using a triangle as a primitive
  persid: ''
- desc: is that we can so, we're always have a uniquely determined plane that we're
    dealing with so, the question what does a matter what the order the vertices of
    a triangle how does that impact we see on the screen let me see if I can it gives
    us an illusion of 3d image with lighting and shading
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, all those things contribute to creating an impression of 3d but more
    basic than that now he gives such great names for these. I think it's this one
  persid: ''
- desc: does this one look like the others? Is is this triangle facing the same way
    as the other triangles? So I would say not and the impact of that is it looks
    like there's a hole so it's not a question of am I missed something there? It's
    a question of how I've ordered the vertices. So that makes sense. Yeah.
  persid: ''
- desc: So we want to deal with hidden surface removal. So we're going to say all
    the surface all the triangles, surfaces that are pointing out will be visible
    now I'm sorry. I whatever it is, it's whatever but but I have
  persid: ''
- desc: interfered with my
  persid: ''
- desc: my sleep and most other things. I think this one is just as solid colors Does
    that make sense? So the way we construct the model has an impact on the way that's
    rendered so we're implicitly defining it the outside of the block of the queue.
    Does that make sense?
  persid: ''
- desc: When you think eon
  persid: ''
- desc: Are you saying the way the further the vertices in the code is going to determine
    the outcome of this?
  persid: ''
- desc: So let's try let's work on Cute. Okay, so we looked at this a lot yesterday.
    So, we're rotating we're not doing the translation of the rotating
  persid: ''
- desc: war
  persid: ''
- desc: zone that a small enough
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so
  persid: ''
- desc: the shaders are doing the rotation. So remember, the matrices are column major.
    So what does that advice what does that mean? How would you rate the RX matrix
    out? Okay, let me start us off Does that make sense? So can't go wrong there.
    The top left corner is one then which value do I place where? Maybe let's do a
    different one. Let's try Okay, so if we're just reading it out
  persid: ''
- desc: still looks looks more like a cheat
  persid: ''
- desc: so am I writing it out in column major order? So or is it
  persid: ''
- desc: this way?
  persid: ''
- desc: So this is another question. Like right handed or left handed coordinate systems.
  persid: ''
- desc: In physics, we have a job online claiming site handle so we're not here to
    make you the conventional better.
  persid: ''
- desc: So WebGL is left handed coordinates. And we're doing call a major.
  persid: ''
- desc: Sorry, isn't right. Next was.
  persid: ''
- desc: I will double check
  persid: ''
- desc: so it's
  persid: ''
- desc: a concern because JavaScript so when they're doing the flattens stuff or flattening
    the env.js file a flattened function in it. are dealing with right hand or grow
    major matrices. So there is an issue and so their standards behave well with them.
    An area but you're we're dealing we're dealing with things across areas. So we
    have to do the translation
  persid: ''
- desc: is a common acceptance also because most of them are population distributed.
    So whenever any researcher or scientist were doing some kind of research, they
    were writing by the right hand and they were using the left hand. So that is why
    most of the laws are left. They can feel anything using this. But same way if
    you have a pen and you need to drop and then use the right
  persid: ''
- desc: so why can't you just agree? So if you're aware that there's two different
    ways of going about it, then that gives you an an insight into addressing issues
    that come up. So I was watching my wife and I were watching Amazing Race. familiar
    with that show or kind of it was called Amazing Race where the American version
    couples, teams of two are traveling around the world doing stuff. And one activity
    last night was going to the Ducati factory in Bologna. Italy and putting together
    a Ducati wheels and brakes and then body panels. And one contestant didn't understand
    how ratchet works and they can switch from to tighten or loosen. And she apparently
    works at Microsoft. So I said to my wife, she's giving computer problem solvers
    a bad name. And she didn't drain. Flip the switch to change whether it's going
    to tightening or loosening anyway,
  persid: ''
- desc: there's also no conventional law for clockwise or anti clockwise like few
    places. They use anti clockwise to protect and that is
  persid: ''
- desc: yeah for the most part it's it's clockwise to tighten sometimes it's left
    to take when they want to make you think about so there is a segment lifted it
    right. Righty tighty, lefty loosey that works in English I don't know how long
    translates anyway I just want you to understand that there are these issues. And
    so the convention is if we so for modeling the vertices and putting them all clockwise
    right handed so the outside so the normal vectors of the triangles are pointing
    out, then we'll see. Like you Okay, anything in here?
  persid: ''
- desc: So, one thing we're doing is we're enabling a DevOps test. So
  persid: ''
- desc: let's
  persid: ''
- desc: let's comment this out. See. All right so standard stuff here. So we're creating
    a color buffer,
  persid: ''
- desc: limiting color
  persid: ''
- desc: and then we have the vertex buffer that we're loading. And then we're making
    the associations between the shaders and those arrays. And then, here we have
    failure location. So we're doing that as a uniform variable. So it's not it's
    not based on vertices. It's information. That's being transmitted is not a perfect
    X basis. You have comments. Okay. You can ask me to even though I can't see you
    behind the monitor
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so we're doing the event listeners. So, the first step up here is to
    call the function color cube, which is defined down here and we write it in in
    terms of quads. So we're. So we have these vertices. So we have the vertex points
    and the colors associated with them we don't want to we want to describe the surface
    in terms of two triangles. Okay. So we have eight vertices here. So x y and Zed
    Okay last one is yt minus five thank you so we're doing the four faces one at
    a time. This is not how I might use the word taking the face so we're defining
    two triangles ABC and a C D
  persid: ''
- desc: so
  persid: ''
- desc: if we mess this up if we switch these two around so we're starting not with
    this vertex we are starting here and going to there. Someone hasn't hit and run
    we're not we didn't just affect the one face. Right we've changed questions are
    very loud
  persid: ''
- desc: so if we think of so we changed this one. So we're impacting the 123 and four
    to like for some of the red face the green face
  persid: ''
- desc: the blue and yellow faces are intact. I gonna say that's blue and not some
    agenda maybe they mess me up here. Blue. There is this promise
  persid: ''
- desc: just because of close action
  persid: ''
- desc: let's make it so who can give me some numbers? For purple so we need red Okay,
    red and blues magenta. So what makes her different? From agenda?
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay purple,
  persid: ''
- desc: indigo, dark magenta lavender orchids, fuchsia, magenta, medium market medium
    purples. Morning see purple is. Okay I can see that's purple now look more purple
    who said lavender anyway, right time for today. So have a look at the code examples
    of chapter four. Chapter four and then wrap up our discussion for on Tuesday.
    Okay. Sounds good. Thank you for your gauging? Time work yes it's not working
    right maybe wait a minute. Oh okay. Evening. black backpack so going to give you
    a very Scandinavia's should be able to get thank you so much. You're welcome.
    Thanks, you too. Have a good weekend.
