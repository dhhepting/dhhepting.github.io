Audio-Transcript:
- desc: 'All right. So starting

    the transcript was started about'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'quarter to 12. So, missed the

    first little bit so we''ll look'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'at some basic environment, basic

    HTML plus JavaScript setup to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run in browsers. And then we''ll

    also look at environments are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'set up to use WebGL and with

    React and Node js,'
  persid: ''
- desc: as well, so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to focus on doing

    some programming and then so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s particulars of how you

    want to do the programming or it'
  persid: ''
- desc: will be up to you
  persid: ''
- desc: 'okay. Don''t want to I don''t know

    if I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: productively zoom. In on this
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s just talk a bit about

    what we got to say'
  persid: ''
- desc: sometimes two d is enough
  persid: ''
- desc: 'examples like Microsoft Excel

    says, Whenever a bar chart or a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'column chart says make a two and

    a half. So looks last year, but'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s harder to make sense of

    information. You can measure'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what you see on the screen

    Excuse me. See how it goes with'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the maths. I don''t want to scare

    you or whatever it is. You don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: want to so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'if it''s transmissible and I

    think maybe'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s related to my training last

    week. Anyway. Sometimes. Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so what are some issues

    involved? So from our picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: from last day
  persid: ''
- desc: here's my 2d example and then
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a 3d version So, what are some

    ideas that are apparent in that'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'version? What kinds of things do

    we need to take care of finish'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'my son''s thoughts try and draw

    something. What''s a three'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'dimensional object that I should

    try and draw? So try and draw'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'house again or to queue or

    column audience participation'
  persid: ''
- desc: part maybe I should draw it.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Like maybe maybe like an ice

    cream cone. So if I'
  persid: ''
- desc: draw when to draw in a sphere
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to represent the ice cream

    anyone getting ice cream cone'
  persid: ''
- desc: out of that
  persid: ''
- desc: 'could be a half the chinstrap

    upside down.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Any other
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any other things you see in this

    dry sorry.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'You get to see what that thing

    is like a certain rule'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'was intended it to be a circle

    but I really want it to be give'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you the impression of a sphere

    so what would help'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how can I improve this drawing

    to give it more of a sense of'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'three dimensions? So shading

    would be helpful for what what'
  persid: ''
- desc: is earlier step than shading
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe the X Y Zed axis joins

    like to draw these coordinates'
  persid: ''
- desc: so so we'll see
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re dealing with computer

    graphics that we''re always'
  persid: ''
- desc: working with trying to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'try to create a sense of realism

    or making making sense of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'geometric model for the bride so

    we see the cube and the sphere'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and so Shaney I want to say it

    also here so that''s supposed to'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'say visible service

    determination so our improved'
  persid: ''
- desc: version of the picture
  persid: ''
- desc: 'because this line in the back

    shouldn''t be visible.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'This is a real multimedia

    experience in this classroom.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Isn't it? Oh, erase that
  persid: ''
- desc: so then
  persid: ''
- desc: let's see if it's waffle cone.
  persid: ''
- desc: Maybe like this and?
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, maybe you can take that as

    a supervisor bunch of facts'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Okay, so these are some of the

    things we need to deal with.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So maybe another one is. So if

    you were aware in space'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'reviewing the scene and then

    projection is'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power we mapping the details

    every geometric model onto a 2d'
  persid: ''
- desc: 2d image plane
  persid: ''
- desc: 'like the whiteboard or the

    bloody blackboard there sorry Do'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you have a question? About

    whatever? Okay.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Can you hear me all right okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I noticed you have a microphone

    here. But I don''t feel like we'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'need to use it in the size of

    room okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so these are the author''s slides

    to go along with the eighth'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'edition the textbook. So I

    thought it might be interesting'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'just to touch on them and then

    we''ll be ready to to go on from'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there next on Thursday. So I I

    would say that we can. We''ll'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'finish our look at Chapter One

    things this week. So today and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Thursday, and we''ll do a little

    bit of programming we''ll go'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'through some details of the

    programming Thursday as well. So'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then we''ll be into Chapter Two

    starting on Tuesday, next week.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So this gives you a history of

    the textbook began using OpenGL'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with C and then we started

    programmable shaders. And lat'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'seven and eight. So the previous

    one and this one. I''ve been'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'focusing on WebGL so I''ll post

    the link here. Let me do that.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Right now.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Then I''ll put in the other link

    here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'they''re not very big on web

    stuff.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Because they don''t they don''t

    even'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'have an index page index dot

    HTML. Page it''s just the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'directory listing here. Make

    sure they work'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay. Okay.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''re gonna talk about

    software, hardware and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'applications of computer

    graphics. And take a top down'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'approach so we''re not. And a

    popular way to go through'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'computer graphics content is to

    say here''s a function from a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'bottom up approach, here''s a

    function to draw a point on the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'screen or pixel and then build

    different things. Build some'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'functions to do the different

    things like hidden surface'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'removal or visible surface

    determination'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and and all the other things

    that we''ll talk about.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Together, this is a top down

    approach. So we have a well'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'established API with WebGL. That

    runs in HTML five, so that''s so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re going to look at the

    concepts in the context of'
  persid: ''
- desc: examples.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So is everyone comfy with sorry

    that''s not a very technical word'
  persid: ''
- desc: comfortable
  persid: ''
- desc: with JavaScript possibly.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'How many people like Java

    scripts? Is one no and one yes.'
  persid: ''
- desc: And let's see. Five undecided.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'What''s that? I don''t like it

    very much. No, I kind of do as'
  persid: ''
- desc: as the No.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So some years ago, this is a

    much earlier version. There was'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a book. So there''s the

    JavaScript book, and then'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'there''s a book called JavaScript

    the good parts, which was a lot'
  persid: ''
- desc: thinner. Anyway.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So we''ll be doing some math and

    use some data structures. And'
  persid: ''
- desc: use it use the API
  persid: ''
- desc: so. So this is his class so
  persid: ''
- desc: 'this book I think, is nice

    because it''s using WebGL and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'it''s using shaders. So we get

    some experience tapping into the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'power of GPU the graphics

    processing unit. So this is an'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'outline of his course. So we''ll

    be looking at WebGL graphics and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'shaders, interaction and

    animation three dimensional'
  persid: ''
- desc: graphics discrete methods, so
  persid: ''
- desc: when things.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So using the terminology we

    discussed we introduced last'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'meeting. What kind of graphic is

    this?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'No, I don''t think so. Well, it

    could it''s a representation of a'
  persid: ''
- desc: three dimensional object
  persid: ''
- desc: 'but we talked about two

    different kinds what why would'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'you sit? Why do you say raster

    so?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So when we make a raster scan

    converting an image we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: discretizing a
  persid: ''
- desc: number of pixels are West
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixels don''t have shapes because

    they are stretched to the NASS.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Given the recipe and
  persid: ''
- desc: 'pixels are seven letter word

    starts and ends with us'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay
  persid: ''
- desc: 'anyone who I guess some letters

    No, that''s not the right that''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not right. Anyone want to guess

    a letter if you''re playing Wheel'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'of Fortune are seen that game

    show samples'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yes.
  persid: ''
- desc: It's not often that we get
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to go from start to finish.

    Anyway, yeah, so pixels are'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'samples. So when we''re creating

    an image on screen, we''re taking'
  persid: ''
- desc: discrete samples
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and. So when we okay so when we

    have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a display like, like the monitor

    screens and so on. They have a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'certain resolution so we''re

    displaying a certain number of'
  persid: ''
- desc: samples on the screen.
  persid: ''
- desc: And then we have
  persid: ''
- desc: 'color display. Food zoom in. We

    can see that there are actually'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'red green and blue dots

    corresponding to the next'
  persid: ''
- desc: location.
  persid: ''
- desc: So if I wanted to
  persid: ''
- desc: 'scan convert my ice cream cone

    here I can so I can store this'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'as a circle and another circle

    while I can store the different'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'elements a description of the of

    the model and the details I can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'store the that is geometry and

    then I can render a sofa I''m'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'gonna make it full size on the

    screen here'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'the vector Scalable Vector

    Graphics model perhaps it''s a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'common web format I can convert

    that into to adjust your damage.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'But it doesn''t start out as a

    discrete damage picture'
  persid: ''
- desc: assigning the samples
  persid: ''
- desc: to take a photograph
  persid: ''
- desc: 'then I''m getting an image of a

    certain resolution and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that''s the screen that''s a

    bitmap'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'or raster image. So anytime we

    want to display whether we have'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a vector, description, image or

    bitmap discrete raster for the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'image we need to convert them

    into samples to display display'
  persid: ''
- desc: them on the screen and
  persid: ''
- desc: so we can think if this is the
  persid: ''
- desc: 'vector description of an image

    might be much more compact,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'especially if you''re doing a

    very large size bitmap image at'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'a very large size then we''re

    allocating liquid we''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'allocating more space for that

    purpose so even though it seems'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'disadvantage that we have

    discrete representation, we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'do a lot of interesting things

    with those discrete'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'representations and create

    striking images so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'when we see them in films we

    don''t think oh that''s a discrete'
  persid: ''
- desc: image
  persid: ''
- desc: 'any computer graphics movies

    heavy for use that make a heavy'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'use of computer graphics and

    you''ve seen recently that are in'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'inspiring. Me ever gonna watch?

    See Marvel? Marvel movies?'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Is would that be a good example?

    Anyway okay I''ll put these up on'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your courses page. So, just with

    the understanding that they''re'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'not to be taken off the copied

    off your courses page, just for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'your use during the semester. So

    it makes sense all right. I just'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'said I''ll put the slides on the

    your courses page, but don''t'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'make copies of them from the

    your courses page please.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Okay, so a simple example
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for and this is code from

    chapter two. So if we''re going'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'to make it say let''s draw a

    triangle. So to create a'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'application to draw a triangle,

    we need two files. There might'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'be more. So one that describes

    the HTML'
  persid: ''
- desc: and when
  persid: ''
- desc: 'that provides the JavaScript

    implementation. So the HTML'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'describes the page and the

    utilities are using and shaders'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and the JavaScript handles the

    graphics from there. So we can'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'run WebGL on recent browsers,

    Chrome, Firefox, Safari, I it''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'IE is is still being developed

    or is it now edge'
  persid: ''
- desc: okay. And
  persid: ''
- desc: 'opera, I guess it''s still is it

    still a going concern? Anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so any recent browser, we should

    be able to have support for'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'WebGL. So JavaScript runs within

    the browser. So it''s using'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'excuse me, local resources. And

    local GPU at whatever''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: available
  persid: ''
- desc: 'so let''s take a look at the

    code.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Excuse me so let''s view source

    real HTML file it''s not excuse'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'me okay. So we have scripts for

    two shaders. And this is'
  persid: ''
- desc: gL
  persid: ''
- desc: SL.
  persid: ''
- desc: 'It''s the shading language. It''s

    a bit like C.'
  persid: ''
- desc: So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can define a simple two

    simple shaders, a vertex shader'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'and a fragment shader, which

    we''ll discuss in more detail so'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re getting the fragment

    shader we''re getting a color'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'here. So what color do we have

    defined here? Are you familiar'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'with red, green and blue? I

    should there''s four values here.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'So what''s the fourth one? Yeah,

    it''s called Alpha.'
  persid: ''
- desc: Yeah, so we can have. So
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we can decide whether whether

    the surface is opaque,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'transparent or some somewhere in

    between. and one for red, zero'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'for green. Zero for blue means

    that we get a solid red color'
  persid: ''
- desc: so there are
  persid: ''
- desc: so we're really
  persid: ''
- desc: 'we''re adding common shaders. So

    the net function'
  persid: ''
- desc: is
  persid: ''
- desc: 'what once the webpage is loaded

    this initializes the graphics'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'environment and then we have a

    render function so, Sorry Let''s'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Well Next sorry I''m gonna try

    and change the color and the'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'size of the triangle before we

    in for the end today. Evening'
  persid: ''
- desc: think that's not going to work
  persid: ''
- desc: so let's go
  persid: ''
- desc: and therefore today
  persid: ''
- desc: think about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'how we might go about changing

    the color of the triangle and'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'maybe adding some more triangles

    any questions or concerns? Okay,'
  persid: ''
- desc: thanks for today.
  persid: ''
- desc: Anyway, well know about
  persid: ''
- desc: 'other people who were here on

    Thursday, but then make it today'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are they doing okay? Still are

    they'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'are you in touch with them?

    Sorry. Okay. Anyway,'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'I don''t mean you have to keep

    tabs on people. Anyway, thanks.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Again for today. We''ll see you

    on Thursday.'
  persid: ''
- desc: 'Again for today. We''ll see you

    on Thursday.'
