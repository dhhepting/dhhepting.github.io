important:
- desc: Enjoyed and understood todays class about vertices, rotation with quadrilaterals
    .
- desc: The most interesting thing i learned was the coordinator system for right
    handed and left handed people. We discussed the issue and drew sketches to understand
    the matter.
- desc: Explaination of Assignment 2 and know about the colour cube
- desc: I learned about right handed and left handed coordinate systems.
- desc: Today I learned about right and left-handed coordinate systems.
- desc: Arrangement of vertices play a major role in the way of the rotation of an
    animation
- desc: How important is the selection between left hand side and right hand side
    of coordinates and how these are affect the vertices and rotation
- desc: I got to know about the variations in a rotating cube with different shades
    &amp;amp; colour pattern.
- desc: Rotating cube and right hand facing rules for objects
