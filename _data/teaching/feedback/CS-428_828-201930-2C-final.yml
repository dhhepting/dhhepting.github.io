change:
- it is good the way it is in almost everything; there could be a change (reduction) in the total number of assignments
- this subject should have lots of team activities in the class
- unfortunately, I came across some videos that were very good for lo-fidelity and hi-fidelity prototyping. The prof could have shared them. It'd have cleared many doubts

- the group project should have been real-time implementation of hi-fi prototype and also there should be testing on that instead of paper review
- having a seminar style course in Computer Science is a challenge. Many students do not have English as a first language so getting discussions going was hard
- class-strength, too crowded
- nothing
- I would like more class activities like the card sorting or board drawing of interfaces, since it promoted participation from all, even nervous people
