1,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,4,5,"The use of piazza and not being solely moodle; the use of visual (media) learning tools; the access to the textbook on hold","Nothing","Ability to make the course content relevant and interesting"
2,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,5,5,"This class helps develop critical thinking, analyzing interfaces and interactions and relate them with our won experience","Not sure","Encouraging student to participate. I am a very shy person but I always feel like answering and participating in the in-class discussions. He is always well prepared and knows his stuff"
3,2,1,2,4,2,2,4,1,3," I like the course because self-study is a bit easy even without the instructors clear class objective. The course is quite interesting and easy to understand","I will like the ??? to be more focus on the course content rather than trying to make the class funny (to some group of people) he should also involve entire class to ensure total participation. The course content should be well broken down with clear expectations.","He has some interesting, deep-thinking videos that stimulates the class to analyze. He is very respectful and kind. He loves what he does and tries his best to make the class fun."

5,3,3,3,2,3,2,4,3,3,"The TED talks, they are interesting","The assignments need more detail. Clearer expectations.",""
6,4,4,4,4,5,4,5,5,5,"The discourse","Could be less 'abstract'","Directs discussion very well"
7,2,3,1,1,4,3,5,3,4,"I enjoy the open discussions that are open to all class members","I would like to see better use of the textbook. It would help if we know what sections are relevant to future discussions so we know what to read in advance. Better explanations for the assignments would also be appreciated",""
8,4,2,4,2,5,5,5,4,5,"There is nothing similar to it offered. It's not just another C++ class","More guidance for assignments","His personality and he is easy to approach"
9,3,3,5,3,5,4,5,4,5,"I enjoy that everything is presented with real world examples and we are given clear to understand examples to back up the theory","Less assignments that feel like make-work projects. The Design Journal is a neat idea but would be better implemented if the entries were cut in half but we were required to pick a topic from the past few weeks and delve much more in depth. Longer entries but fewer of them. It currently feels too much like I am rewriting my notes and it is hard to go further into detail on topics.","Willingness to get feedback from students"
10,4,3,3,2,3,4,5,3,3,"How to think about user design. Now, outside of the class I look and think about UI and whether it's a good design or bad","Less homework","His knowledge about UI is good enough"

14,4,3,4,3,5,4,5,5,5,"It's always interesting and engaging","Sometimes assignment specifications are vague","I don't know how to articulate it, but I seldom speak up in classes, yet in this one I do, so whatever he's done to put my crippling social anxiety at ease and encourage discussions is certainly a strength"
15,4,4,5,5,3,4,5,5,5,"Easy to understand and related to softwares for the real world make it easy to understand and makes it best","I would say a little bit more explanation and elaboration and clear concepts regarding the teaching material for this course","He is always calm, attentive, always ready to help and answer and tries to make class creative"

17,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,"Very informative and interactive class. Let the student participate at every point and makes it interesting for the students. Videos and other interactive design binds the student's interest (piazza makes it interesting too)","I think class timings :) (Nothing as such, very well planned lectures and interesting stuff)","Tries to make class interactive; fully aware about course content and excellent planning for lectures; let the student pursue their own interest and respect their ideas"
18,5,4,5,5,5,4,5,5,5,"It allows a lot of freedom in discovering good/bad design. Freedom given in assignments makes them more interesting.","Not a fan of piazza and the other applications other than URcourses. I find its hard to keep track of what's going on there, plus URcourses, plus the prof's website. Especially with other classes being on URcourses.","Allows for discussion. There's no pressure, or fear, of giving the wrong answer"
19,3,3,0,4,2,2,3,4,2,"Very ???","The mode of discussion. The prof has to be more audible","His ??? knowledge about interactive design"
20,4,4,4,5,5,4,5,5,5,"TED talks and videos","Links to assignments, project, exam, etc. on URcourses; shuffling between homepage, URcourses, piazza, and gradescope slows things down","Clear grading scheme"
21,5,5,4,4,5,4,5,5,4,"Interactions","Uniformity in submitting course related records","Interactive and informative"
22,2,2,2,3,3,2,5,3,4,"I like the content of the course","A stricter routine and speedier progression during class. Smaller class or separating into groups to discuss better design or thoughts on videos","I think he genuinely enjoys a good design as well as a poor one we can evaluate"
23,5,4,4,3,4,3,3,4,5,"It is more interactive class and the conceptual building is real fun in class","For those who are having first experience needs more example to define","He is communicating well and try to answer his best accordingly it really help. By showing different examples."
