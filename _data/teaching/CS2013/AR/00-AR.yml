  Computing professionals should not regard the computer as just a
  black box that executes programs by magic. The knowledge area
  Architecture and Organization builds on Systems
  Fundamentals (SF) to develop a deeper understanding of the
  hardware environment upon which
  all computing is based, and the interface it provides to higher
  software layers. Students should
  acquire an understanding and appreciation of a computer system’s
  functional components, their characteristics, performance, and
  interactions, and, in particular, the challenge of harnessing
  parallelism to sustain performance improvements now and into
  the future. Students need to understand computer architecture
  to develop programs that can achieve high performance
  through a programmer’s awareness of parallelism and latency. In
  selecting a system to use, students should be able to understand
  the tradeoff among various components, such as CPU
  clock speed, cycles per instruction, memory size, and average
  memory access time.

  The learning outcomes specified for these topics correspond
  primarily to the core and are intended to support programs
  that elect to require only the minimum 16 hours of computer
  architecture of their students. For programs that want to
  teach more than the minimum, the same AR topics can be treated
  at a more advanced level by implementing a two-course
  sequence. For programs that want to cover the elective
  topics, those topics can be introduced within a two-course
  sequence and/or be treated in a more comprehensive way in a
  third course.
