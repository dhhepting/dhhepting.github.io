  desc: "Computers and the Internet, perhaps more than any other technologies, have transformed society over the past 75 years, with dramatic increases in human productivity; an explosion of options for news, entertainment, and communication; and fundamental breakthroughs in almost every branch of science and engineering. Social Context provides the foundation for all other SP knowledge units, especially Professional Ethics. Also see cross-referencing with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Networking and Communication (NC) Knowledge Areas."
