title: "Human-Computer Interaction"
abbrev: HCI
desc:
  - para: Human-computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing interactions between human activities and the computational systems that support them, and with constructing interfaces to afford those interactions.
  - para: Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface that includes both software and hardware. Thus interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface &mdash; for better or worse.
  - para: Because it deals with people as well as computational systems, as a knowledge area HCI demands the consideration of cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues. Consequently it draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions, including psychology, ergonomics, computer science, graphic and product design, anthropology and engineering
