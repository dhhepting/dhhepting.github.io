  Human-computer interaction (HCI) is concerned with designing interactions between human
  activities and the computational systems that support them,
  and with constructing interfaces to afford those interactions.
  Interaction between users and computational artefacts occurs at an interface that includes both
  software and hardware. Thus interface design impacts the software life-cycle in that it should
  occur early; the design and implementation of core functionality can influence the user interface
  â€“ for better or worse.

  Because it deals with people as well as computational systems, as a knowledge area HCI
  demands the consideration of cultural, social, organizational, cognitive and perceptual issues.
  Consequently it draws on a variety of disciplinary traditions, including psychology, ergonomics,
  computer science, graphic and product design, anthropology and engineering.
