Preamble: "For nearly every computer scientist and software developer, an understanding of how humans interact with machines is essential. While these topics may be covered in a standard undergraduate graphics course, they may also be covered in introductory computer science and programming courses. Part of our motivation for including immediate and retained modes is that these modes are analogous to polling vs. event driven programming. This is a fundamental question in computer science: Is there a button object, or is there just the display of a button on the screen? Note that most of the outcomes in this section are at the knowledge level, and many of these topics are revisited in greater depth in later sections."

Learning-Outcomes:
- label: l01
  desc: Identify common uses of digital presentation to humans (e.g., computer graphics, sound). [Familiarity]
- label: l02
  desc: Explain in general terms how analog signals can be reasonably represented by discrete samples, for example, how images can be represented by pixels. [Familiarity]
- label: l03
  desc: Explain how the limits of human perception affect choices about the digital representation of analog signals. [Familiarity]
- label: l04
  desc: Construct a simple user interface using a standard API. [Usage]
- label: l05
  desc: Describe the differences between lossy and lossless image compression techniques, for example as reflected in common graphics image file formats such as JPG, PNG, MP3, MP4, and GIF. [Familiarity]
- label: l06
  desc: Describe color models and their use in graphics display devices. [Familiarity]
- label: l07
  desc: Describe the tradeoffs between storing information vs. storing enough information to reproduce the information, as in the difference between vector and raster rendering. [Familiarity]
- label: l08
  desc: Describe the basic process of producing continuous motion from a sequence of discrete frames (sometimes called “flicker fusion”). [Familiarity]
- label: l09
  desc: Describe how double-buffering can remove flicker from animation. [Familiarity]
