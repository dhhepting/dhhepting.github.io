Preamble: "Computer ethics is a branch of practical philosophy that deals with how computing professionals should make decisions regarding professional and social conduct. There are three primary influences: 1) an individual's own personal code; 2) any informal code of ethical behavior existing in the work place; and 3) exposure to formal codes of ethics. See cross-referencing with the Information Assurance and Security (IAS) Knowledge Area."
