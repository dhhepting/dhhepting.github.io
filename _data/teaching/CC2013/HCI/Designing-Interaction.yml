Motivation: CS students need a minimal set of well-established methods and tools to bring to interface construction.

Topics:
- Principles of graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
- Elements of visual design (layout, colour, fonts, labelling)
- Task analysis, including qualitative aspects of generating task analytic models
- Low-fidelity (paper) prototyping
- Quantitative evaluation techniques, e.g., keystroke-level evaluation
- Help and documentation
- Handling human/system failure
- User interface standards

Learning-Outcomes:
- For an identified user group, undertake and document an analysis of their needs. [Assessment]
- Create a simple application, together with help and documentation, that supports a graphical user interface. [Usage]
- Conduct a quantitative evaluation and discuss/report the results. [Usage]
- Discuss at least one national or international user interface design standard. [Familiarity]
