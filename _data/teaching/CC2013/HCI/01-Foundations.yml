preamble:
- label: Motivation
  desc: For end-users, the interface is the system. So design in this domain must be interaction-focused and human-centered. Students need a different repertoire of techniques to address this than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum.

topics:
- label: t01
  desc: Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games)
- label: t02
  desc: Processes for user-centered development, e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design
- label: t03
  desc: Different measures for evaluation, e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction
- label: t04
  desc: Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing
- label: t05
  desc: Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, e.g., color perception, ergonomics
- label: t06
  desc: Cognitive models that inform interaction design, e.g., attention, perception and recognition, movement, and memory; gulfs of expectation and execution
- label: t07
  desc: Social models that inform interaction design, e.g., culture, communication, networks and organizations
- label: t08
  desc: Principles of good design and good designers; engineering tradeoffs
- label: t09
  desc: Accessibility, e.g., interfaces for differently-abled populations (e.g., blind, motion-impaired)
- label: t10
  desc: Interfaces for differently-aged population groups (e.g., children, 80+)

outcomes:
- label: l01
  desc: Discuss why human-centered software development is important. [Familiarity]
- label: l02
  desc: Summarize the basic precepts of psychological and social interaction. [Familiarity]
- label: l03
  desc: "Develop and use a conceptual vocabulary for analyzing human interaction with software: affordance, conceptual model, feedback, and so forth. [Usage]"
- label: l04
  desc: Define a user-centered design process that explicitly takes account of the fact that the user is not like the developer or their acquaintances. [Usage]
- label: l05
  desc: Create and conduct a simple usability test for an existing software application. [Assessment]
