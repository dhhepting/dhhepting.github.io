preamble:
- label: Motivation
  desc: An exploration of techniques to ensure that end-users are fully considered at all stages of the design process, from inception to implementation.

topics:
- label: t01
  desc: Approaches to, and characteristics of, the design process
- label: t02
  desc: Functionality and usability requirements (cross-reference to SE/Requirements Engineering)
- label: t03
  desc: Techniques for gathering requirements, e.g., interviews, surveys, ethnographic and contextual enquiry
- label: t04
  desc: Techniques and tools for the analysis and presentation of requirements, e.g., reports, personas
- label: t05
  desc: Prototyping techniques and tools, e.g., sketching, storyboards, low-fidelity prototyping, wireframes
- label: t06
  desc: Evaluation without users, using both qualitative and quantitative techniques, e.g., walkthroughs, GOMS, expert-based analysis, heuristics, guidelines, and standards
- label: t07
  desc: Evaluation with users, e.g., observation, think-aloud, interview, survey, experiment
- label: t08
  desc: Challenges to effective evaluation, e.g., sampling, generalization
- label: t09
  desc: Reporting the results of evaluations
- label: t10
  desc: Internationalization, designing for users from other cultures, cross-cultural

outcomes:
- label: l01
  desc: Explain how user-centered design complements other software process models. [Familiarity]
- label: l02
  desc: Use lo-fi (low fidelity) prototyping techniques to gather, and report, user responses. [Usage]
- label: l03
  desc: Choose appropriate methods to support the development of a specific UI. [Assessment]
- label: l04
  desc: Use a variety of techniques to evaluate a given UI. [Assessment]
- label: l05
  desc: Compare the constraints and benefits of different evaluative methods. [Assessment]
