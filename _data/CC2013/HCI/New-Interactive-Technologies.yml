Motivation: As technologies evolve, new interaction styles are made possible. This knowledge unit should be considered extensible, to track emergent technology.
Topics:
- Choosing interaction styles and interaction techniques
- "Representing information to users: navigation, representation, manipulation"
- Approaches to design, implementation and evaluation of non-mouse interaction
- Touch and multi-touch interfaces
- Shared, embodied, and large interfaces
- New input modalities (such as sensor and location data)
- New Windows, e.g., iPhone, Android
- Speech recognition and natural language processing (cross reference IS/Natural Language Processing)
- Wearable and tangible interfaces
- Persuasive interaction and emotion
- Ubiquitous and context-aware interaction technologies (Ubicomp)
- Bayesian inference (e.g. predictive text, guided pointing)
- Ambient/peripheral display and interaction
Learning-Outcomes:
- Describe when non-mouse interfaces are appropriate. [Familiarity]
- Understand the interaction possibilities beyond mouse-and-pointer interfaces. [Familiarity]
- Discuss the advantages (and disadvantages) of non-mouse interfaces. [Assessment]
