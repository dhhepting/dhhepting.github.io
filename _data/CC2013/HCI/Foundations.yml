Motivation: For end-users, the interface is the system. So design in this domain must be interaction-focused and human-centered. Students need a different repertoire of techniques to address this than is provided elsewhere in the curriculum.
Topics:
- Contexts for HCI (anything with a user interface, e.g., webpage, business applications, mobile applications, and games)
- Processes for user-centered development, e.g., early focus on users, empirical testing, iterative design
- Different measures for evaluation, e.g., utility, efficiency, learnability, user satisfaction
- Usability heuristics and the principles of usability testing
- Physical capabilities that inform interaction design, e.g., color perception, ergonomics
- Cognitive models that inform interaction design, e.g., attention, perception and recognition, movement, and memory; gulfs of expectation and execution
- Social models that inform interaction design, e.g., culture, communication, networks and organizations
- Principles of good design and good designers; engineering tradeoffs
- Accessibility, e.g., interfaces for differently-abled populations (e.g., blind, motion-impaired)
- Interfaces for differently-aged population groups (e.g., children, 80+)
Learning-Outcomes:
- Discuss why human-centered software development is important. [Familiarity]
- Summarize the basic precepts of psychological and social interaction. [Familiarity]
- "Develop and use a conceptual vocabulary for analyzing human interaction with software: affordance, conceptual model, feedback, and so forth. [Usage]"
- Define a user-centered design process that explicitly takes account of the fact that the user is not like the developer or their acquaintances. [Usage]
- Create and conduct a simple usability test for an existing software application. [Assessment]
