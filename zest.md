### {{ page.title }}

Your blog entry is to be posted in the [blog on URcourses](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/oublog/view.php?id=1036240). References are to be included as hyperlinks within the post, close to the text that makes the reference.

From [Nielsen and Morkes](<https://www.nngroup.com/articles/concise-scannable-and-objective-how-to-write-for-the-web/>), here are some ways to write for the web:

##### Conventional Guidelines for Good Writing are Good

Conventional guidelines include carefully organizing the information, using words and categories that make sense to the audience, using topic sentences, limiting each paragraph to one main idea, and providing the right amount of information.

##### Text Should be [Scannable](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/layer-cake-pattern-scanning/)

Scanning can save users time. Most people are likely to approach unfamiliar Web text by trying to scan it before reading it. Elements that enhance scanning include headings, large type, bold text, highlighted text, bulleted lists, graphics, captions, and topic sentences.

##### Text Should be Concise

Consistent with users' desire to get information quickly is their preference for short text.

##### Users Like Summaries and the Inverted Pyramid Style

Web writing that presents news, summaries, and conclusions up front is useful and saves time. A news story written in the inverted pyramid style (in which news and conclusions are presented first, followed by details and background information), are well-received.

##### Hypertext is Well-Liked

"The incredible thing that's available on the Web is the ability to go deeper for more information." However, hypertext may be distracting if a site contains "too many" links.

[Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/weblog-usability-top-ten-mistakes/) also provides a list of mistakes to avoid, which include the following 3 that are most relevant to us:
* Nondescript Posting Titles: Users must be able to grasp the gist of an article by reading its headline. Avoid cute or humorous headlines that make no sense out of context.
* Links Don't Say Where They Go: Many weblog authors seem to think it's cool to write link anchors like: " some people think" or "there's more here and here ." Remember one of the basics of the Web: Life is too short to click on an unknown. Tell people where they're going and what they'll find at the other end of the link. Generally, you should provide predictive information in either the anchor text itself or the immediately surrounding words.
* Forgetting That You Write for Your Future Boss: Whenever you post anything to the Internet — whether on a weblog, in a discussion group, or even in an email — think about how it will look to a hiring manager in ten years. Once stuff's out, it's archived, cached, and indexed in many services that you might never be aware of.

### Submission

Post your blog entry in the course and then submit only the hyperlink to it:
* once you have posted your entry, click on "Permalink" at the bottom left of your posted entry.

* go to [Submit Link to "Blog Entry"](https://urcourses.uregina.ca/mod/assign/view.php?id=909822) and choose "Add submission" or "Edit submission".
